    "question": "who did the original version of hey joe",
    "long_answer": "Hey Joe \" is an American popular song from the 1960s that has become a rock standard and has been performed in many musical styles by hundreds of different artists. \"Hey Joe\" tells the story of a man who is on the run and planning to head to Mexico after shooting his unfaithful wife. The song was registered for copyright in the United States in 1962 by Billy Roberts . However, diverse credits and claims have led to confusion about the song's authorship . The earliest known commercial recording of the song is the late-1965 single by the Los Angeles garage band the Leaves ; the band then re-recorded the track and released it in 1966 as a follow-up single which became a hit. The best-known version is the Jimi Hendrix Experience 's 1966 recording. The song title is sometimes given as \"Hey Joe, Where You Gonna Go?\" or similar variations. <DIV",

    "question": "who had spearheaded the movement against the tradition of sati",
    "long_answer": "Under British rule , the practice was initially tolerated. In the province of Bengal, sati was attended by a colonial government official, which states historian A.F. Salahuddin Ahmed , \"not only seemed to accord an official sanction, but also increased its prestige value\". Between 1815 and 1818, the number of sati in Bengal province doubled from 378 to 839. Under sustained campaigning against sati by Christian missionaries such as William Carey and Brahmin Hindu reformers such as Ram Mohan Roy , the provincial government banned sati in 1829 . This was followed up by similar laws by the authorities in the princely states of India in the ensuing decades, with a general ban for the whole of India issued by Queen Victoria in 1861. In Nepal , sati was banned in 1920. The Indian Sati Prevention Act from 1988 further criminalised any type of aiding, abetting, and glorifying of sati .",

The slang meaning of the term dates to the next year, 1951, when Newsweek magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for drip or square in Detroit , Michigan . By the early 1960s, usage of the term had spread throughout the United States, and even as far as Scotland. At some point, the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude. <",

Gimple October 23, 2016 ( 2016-10-23 ) 17.03 Negan's victim is revealed to be Abraham, who is beaten to death in front of Rick's group. Daryl punches Negan out of anger, prompting Negan to also murder Glenn. After several tests, Negan ultimately breaks Rick's resolve by nearly forcing him to hack off Carl's arm. Negan and his crew then leave with Daryl as hostage, while Sasha volunteers to take Maggie to Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. 85 2 \" The Well \" Greg Nicotero Matthew Negrete October 30, 2016 ( 2016-10-30 ) 12.46 Carol and Morgan arrive at the Kingdom, a well-established community run by flamboyant former zookeeper \"King\" Ezekiel. The Kingdom, like Hilltop, has been producing for the Saviors under the threat of violence, although Ezekiel has kept this arrangement secret from most residents of the Kingdom. Carol recuperates and eagerly prepares to abandon the community, but opts to stay in an isolated house nearby after bonding with Ezekiel. 86 3 \" The Cell \" Alrick Riley Angela Kang November 6, 2016 ( 2016-11-06 ) 11.72 Daryl is locked in a cell at the Sanctuary, where Negan and Dwight constantly torture him in an effort to break him down to obedience. Negan sends Dwight on a mission to retrieve an escaped Savior, who says he would rather die than return to the Sanctuary. Dwight, therefore, ultimately mercy-kills the man. Daryl is given the opportunity to become a Savior but adamantly refuses. 87 4 \" Service \" David Boyd Corey Reed November 13, 2016 ( 2016-11-13 ) 11.40 As the grieving survivors struggle to come to terms with life under Negan's rule, Negan and the Saviors arrive at Alexandria days ahead of schedule for their first offering and take most of Alexandria's furniture and medicine, and all their firearms. Feeling powerless, Rick informs the survivors that he is no longer in charge and they must learn to live by Negan's terms. Rosita finds an empty cartridge case and brings it to Eugene, tasking him to craft a live, usable cartridge for a gun she found in the woods. 88 5 \" Go Getters \" Darnell Martin Channing Powell November 20, 2016 ( 2016-11-20 ) 11.00 Carl accompanies Enid to Hilltop to visit Maggie, who is recovering there with Sasha. Gregory is furious with Maggie and Sasha for not fulfilling their deal to kill the Saviors, and demands they leave. However, after they help defend Hilltop from a walker attack, Jesus convinces Gregory to let them stay. While the Saviors raid Hilltop's supplies, Sasha asks Jesus if he can find where Negan lives, which he agrees to do. Jesus then sneaks onto one of the Saviors' trucks, where he finds Carl hiding. 89 6 \" Swear \" Michael E.

    "long_answer": "Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man : The leader and benefactor of the Avengers , who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making. Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark \"senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe\". Downey added that Stark would have smaller goals than in previous films. Chris Hemsworth as Thor : An Avenger and the king of Asgard , based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name . Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of Thor: Ragnarok (2017), which finds him in a \"very profound... very interesting place\" with \"real emotional motivation\". At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted Thor: Ragnarok director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film. Joe Russo said that Thor has \"the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument\" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos . Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk : An Avenger and a genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation , transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and also tries to \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\". Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.\" Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok ... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control.\" Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and concludes in the Infinity War sequel , with the difference between Hulk and Banner \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America : A fugitive superhero and leader of a faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Joe Russo said after the events of Captain America: Civil War (2016), Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others. The character embodies the \"spirit\" of his comic alternate identity Nomad in the film, and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his traditional shield . An early draft of the film experimented with Rogers first appearing in the film saving Vision from Corvus Glaive 's attack in Wakanda . Markus and McFeely said they we",

The iPhone 3G added 3G network support, and was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware, the 4 with a metal chassis, higher display resolution and front-facing camera, and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri . The iPhone 5 featured a taller, 4-inch display and Apple's newly introduced Lightning connector . In 2013, Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader , and the lower-cost 5C , a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal. They were followed by the larger iPhone 6 , with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays. The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs , as well as the SE \u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID , but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID .

These teams are classified by skill. Not all cities will have teams at all skill levels, depending on size and the popularity of hockey, however even small communities may field teams at multiple levels. (For example: Orillia , Ontario , with a population of 30,000, has four distinct skill divisions for 7-year-olds.) The classifications are typically not certified by any external organization, so there is speculation about what levels are truly better or stronger than others. AAA, AA, and A hockey are nationally recognized as competitive levels of organized hockey, with AAA being elite competition. The competitive level players generally engage in high levels of physical play from a young age. This physical play can lead to injuries and most often these are related to the head. Injuries have become more prevalent as physical play has increased in the sport. <",

She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%.

The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.",

In December 1884, alarmed by Japanese ambitions in Korea, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered her ministers to extricate China from the undeclared war with France that had broken out on 23 August. Important French victories in Tonkin and Formosa in February and early March 1885 strengthened her desire to end the Sino-French War, and although the Chinese won an unexpected victory in Tonkin in late March, defeating General de N\u00e9grier's 2nd Brigade at Bang Bo and reoccupying Lang Son , this success was counterbalanced by the simultaneous French capture of the Pescadores Islands . China's position in early April 1885 was critical. Seizing the opportunity offered by the fall of the Ferry ministry, the Chinese agreed to implement the provisions of the May 1884 Tientsin Accord , which recognised France's protectorate over Vietnam. In return, the French dropped their longstanding demand for an indemnity for the Bac Le Ambush . After a flurry of negotiations in Paris in the first days of April 1885, peace was made on this basis. 11 May 1884 - The Tientsin Accord or Li\u2013Fournier Convention , concluded on 11 May 1884, was intended to settle an undeclared war between France and China over the sovereignty of Tonkin (northern Vietnam). The convention, negotiated by Li Hung-chang for China and capitaine de vaisseau Fran\u00e7ois-Ernest Fournier for France, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam. 9 June 1885 - The Treaty of Tientsin , signed on 9 June 1885, officially ended the Sino-French War . The unequal treaty restated in greater detail the main provisions of the Tientsin Accord , signed between France and China on 11 May 1884. As Article 2 required China to recognise the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin established by the Treaty of Hue in June 1884, implicitly abandoning her own claims to suzerainty over Vietnam, the treaty formalised France's victory in the Sino-French War . 1887 \u2013 In the 19th century, Europeans found that Chinese fishermen from Hainan annually visited the Spratly islands for part of the year, while in 1877 it was the British who launched the first modern legal claims to the Spratlys. 1887 \u2013 The Convention Respecting the Delimitation of the Frontier Between China and Tonkin between France and the Qing Empire set the maritime boundary in the Gulf of Tonkin .

    "question": "where are taste buds located in your mouth",
    "long_answer": "Taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells. The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue , soft palate , upper esophagus , the cheek and epiglottis . These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception : salty , sour , bitter , sweet and umami ; through the combination of these elements we detect \"flavors.\" A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue ; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves. <",

    "question": "before 1829 who held the keys to the melchizedek priesthood",
    "long_answer": "Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery said they were visited by John the Baptist , who laid his hands on their head and gave them the Aaronic priesthood ; Smith described the event in detail and gave an exact date when it happened. In contrast, he never gave a description of any vision in which he saw an angel separately confer the Melchizedek priesthood. However, by the turn of the 20th century, Latter Day Saint theologians believed that such a separate ordination by angels had occurred prior to the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830. This was largely because the early church organization contained the office of elder , which at least by 1835 was considered an office of the Melchizedek priesthood. As evidence for such a pre-organization angellic conferral, writers referred to a revelation in which Smith said he heard \"The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!\" Thus, most Mormons suppose that Smith and Cowdery were visited by the three angels in 1829 and that they conferred the Melchizedek priesthood in the same way John the Baptist had conferred the Aaronic priesthood.

    "long_answer": "Margaret Drabble described it in literature as taking place \"roughly between 1770 and 1848\", and few dates much earlier than 1770 will be found. In English literature, M. H. Abrams placed it between 1789, or 1798, this latter a very typical view, and about 1830, perhaps a little later than some other critics. Others have proposed 1780\u20131830. In other fields and other countries the period denominated as Romantic can be considerably different; musical Romanticism, for example, is generally regarded as only having ceased as a major artistic force as late as 1910, but in an extreme extension the Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are described stylistically as \"Late Romantic\" and were composed in 1946\u201348.

Rockwell said, \"I worked with Jon Favreau on this film called Made . And Justin Theroux, who wrote the script, is an old friend of mine, they sort of cooked up this idea and pitched it to Kevin Feige . What they did, they were maybe going to do one villain like they did with Jeff Bridges , but then they decided to split the villains.

Madeline talks to Joseph about his wife knowing about their affair. Jane tells Celeste that her son Max is the bully. When preparing to leave for trivia night, Perry sees a text message on Celeste's phone from the landlady of her new apartment. He confronts her on the way to the party, but is interrupted by Renata.

Celeste joins the women, followed by Perry. Bonnie follows them and watches the group from afar. Jane sees Perry and realizes that he is the rapist. Perry pleads with Celeste to come back home with him and when she declines, he viciously attacks her.

    "question": "when were seat belts first required in cars",
    "long_answer": "seat belt laws in the United States are left to the states. However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that required all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions. This law has since been modified to require three-point seat belts in outboard-seating positions, and finally three-point seat belts in all seating positions. Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was the first state to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984.

    "long_answer": "Type (criteria) Site Location Description Image Year Ref Cultural: (ii)(iv) Baroque Churches of the Philippines Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte The Church of San Agust\u00edn at Paoay is the most outstanding example in the Philippines of ' Earthquake Baroque '. Fourteen buttresses are ranged along the lines of a giant volute supporting a smaller one and surmounted by pyramidal finials . A pair of buttresses at the midpoint of each nave wall have stairways for access to the roof. The lower part of the apse and most of the walls are constructed of coral stone blocks, the upper levels being finished in brick, but this order is reversed on the facade. The massive coral stone bell tower, which was added half a century after the church was completed, stands at some distance from the church, again as a protection against damage during earthquakes. 1993 Santa Maria Church in Ilocos Sur Unlike other town churches in the Philippines, which conform to the Spanish tradition of sitting them on the central plaza, the Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asuncion in Santa Maria with its convento are on a hill surrounded by a defensive wall. Also unusual are the sitting of the convento parallel to the facade of the church and that of the separate bell tower (characteristic of Philippine-Hispanic architecture) at the midpoint of the nave wall. This was dictated by the hill on which it is located. The brick church follows the standard Philippine layout, with a monumental facade masking a straight roof-line covering a long rectangular building. It is alleged to be built on a solid raft as a precaution against earthquake damage. The walls are devoid of ornament but have delicately carved side entrances and strong buttresses. Miagao Church in Iloilo The Church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva stands on the highest point of Miagao , its towers serving as lookouts against Muslim raids. It is the finest surviving example of 'Fortress Baroque'. The sumptuous facade epitomizes the Filipino transfiguration of western decorative elements, with the figure of Saint Christopher on the pediment dressed in native clothes, carrying the Christ Child on his back, and holding on to a coconut palm for support. The entire riotously decorated facade is flanked by massive tapering bell towers of unequal heights. San Agustin Church in Manila The Church of the Immaculate Conception of San Agust\u00edn was the first church built on the island of Luzon in 1571, immediately after the Spanish conquest of Manila. A site within the district of Intramuros was assigned to the Augustinian Order , the first to evangelize in the Philippines. In 1587 the impermanent earliest building in wood and palm fronds was replaced by a stone church and monastery in stone, the latter becoming the Augustinian mother house in the Philippines. It was the only structure in Intramuros to survive the liberation of Manila in 1945. Miag-ao became an independent parish in 1731, when a simple church and convento were built. However, destruction",

However, often these cannot be mined due to the acute shortage of electricity in the country, as well as the lack of proper tools to mine these materials and an antiquated industrial base. Coal, iron ore, limestone, and magnesite deposits are larger than other mineral commodities. Mining joint ventures with other countries include China, Canada, Egypt, and South Korea.",

    "question": "what is the primary fuel that would be used in fusion reactors",
    "long_answer": "Fusion processes require fuel and a highly confined environment with a high temperature and pressure , to create a plasma in which fusion can occur. In stars, the most common fuel is hydrogen , and gravity creates the high temperature and confinement needed for fusion. Fusion reactors generally use hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium and tritium , which react more easily, and create a confined plasma of millions of degrees using inertial methods ( laser ) or magnetic methods ( tokamak and similar), although many other concepts have been attempted. The major challenges in realising fusion power are to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature and density, for a long term reaction to occur, and for the most common reactions, managing neutrons that are released during the reaction, which over time can degrade many common materials used within the reaction chamber.",

(June 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) With the full moon approaching, Ondina tries to warn Erik not to activate the merman chamber, but Erik refuses to listen even to her. A now powerless Zac has seemingly given up despite encouragement from Mimmi, Evie, and Cam. Zac later musters up the courage and follows Erik to the chamber to try and stop him. The girls also race to the chamber to stop Erik. Zac fights with Erik for the stone but he shakes him off and finally activates the chamber. The girls attempt to destroy the stone with their moon rings, but it merely absorbs their power. The chamber drains the magic from the moon pool and slowly begins to kill the mermaids except Evie. Horrified by what he's done, Erik tries to deactivate the chamber but is unsuccessful. Evie arrives and helps an injured Zac to his feet. He successfully deactivates the chamber and saves the mermaids but seemingly dies in the process. Desperate to save her brother, Mimmi grabs the stone and places it over Zac's heart.

Once the four wards were developed in the mid-1730s, two additional wards were laid out. The layout of a square and eight surrounding blocks was known as a \"ward.\" The original plan (now known as the Oglethorpe Plan ) was part of a larger regional plan that included gardens, farms, and \"out-lying villages.\" While some authorities believe that the original plan allowed for growth of the city and thus expansion of the grid, the regional plan suggests otherwise: the ratio of town lots to country lots was in balance and growth of the urban grid would have destroyed that balance.",

    "long_answer": "1949 , a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952 , is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963 , legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod , Jock Hutchinson , Gene Sarazen , Sam Snead , Byron Nelson , Arnold Palmer , Jack Nicklaus , and Gary Player .

There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. Millennials are sometimes referred to as \"echo boomers\" due to a major surge in birth rates in the 1980s and 1990s, and because millennials are often the children of the baby boomers . The 20th-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued, however, so the relative impact of the \"baby boom echo\" was generally less pronounced than the post\u2013World War II baby boom .",

He was unaware that Cersei's three children were therefore fathered by her brother Jaime . More interested in food, drink, and tourneys than in governance, Robert has squandered the royal treasury, leaving the crown heavily in debt. After he dies in a hunting accident orchestrated by Cersei, the kingdoms plunge into civil war. His death incites the war that encompasses the entirety of the following two books, the War of the Five Kings, in which his two brothers, Lords Renly and Stannis Baratheon , declare themselves the rightful kings. Robb Stark is also declared King in the North and King of the Trident, and Lord Balon Greyjoy declares himself King of the Iron Islands. <",

    "question": "how is the information in the genetic code used",
    "long_answer": "Information-theoretic approaches model the process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an error-prone information channel. The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise while accurately and efficiently translating information? These \"rate-distortion\" models suggest that the genetic code originated as a result of the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem . Game theory: Models based on <A href=\"",

    "question": "who does the voices in the iron giant",
    "long_answer": "Eli Marienthal as Hogarth Hughes, an intelligent, energetic and curious 9-year-old boy with an active imagination. Marienthal's performances were videotaped and given to animators to work with, which helped develop expressions and acting for the character. Vin Diesel as The Iron Giant, a fifty-foot, metal-eating robot. Created for an unknown purpose, the Giant involuntarily reacts defensively if he recognizes anything as a weapon, immediately attempting to destroy it. The Giant's voice was originally to be electronically modulated but the filmmakers decided they \"needed a deep, resonant and expressive voice to start with,\" so they hired Vin Diesel . Christopher McDonald as Kent Mansley, a government agent sent to investigate sightings of the Iron Giant. The logo on his official government car says he is from the \" Bureau of Unexplained Phenomena \". Harry Connick, Jr. as Dean McCoppin, a beatnik artist and junkyard owner. Bird felt it appropriate to make the character a member of the beat generation , as they were viewed as mildly threatening to small-town values during that time. An outsider himself, he is among the first to recognize the Giant as no threat. Jennifer Aniston as Annie Hughes, the widow of a military pilot and Hogarth's mother. John Mahoney as General Shannon Rogard, an experienced and levelheaded military leader in Washington, D.C. who strongly dislikes Mansley. M. Emmet Walsh as Earl Stutz, a sailor and the first man to see the robot. James Gammon as Marv Loach, a foreman who follows the robot's trail after it destroys the power station. James Gammon also voices Floyd Toubeaux Cloris Leachman as Mrs. Lynley Tensedge, Hogarth's schoolteacher Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas as the train engineers. Johnston and Thomas were animators and members of Disney's Nine Old Men . Bird cited them as inspirations for his career and incorporated their voices and likenesses into the film. <SPAN",

    "question": "the olfactory region can sense approximately how many odors",
    "long_answer": "[23] Researchers in the most recent study, which tested the psychophysical responses to combinations of over 128 unique odor molecules with combinations composed of up to 30 different component molecules, noted that this estimate is \"conservative\" and that some subjects of their research might be capable of deciphering between a thousand trillion odorants, adding that their worst performer could probably still distinguish between 80 million scents. Authors of the study concluded, \"This is far more than previous estimates of distinguishable olfactory stimuli. It demonstrates that the human olfactory system, with its hundreds of different olfactory receptors, far out performs the other senses in the number of physically different stimuli it can discriminate.\" However, it was also noted by the authors that the ability to distinguish between smells is not analogous to being able to consistently identify them, and that subjects were not typically capable of identifying individual odor stimulants from within the odors the researchers had prepared from multiple odor molecules. In November 2014 the study was strongly criticized by Caltech scientist Markus Meister, who wrote that the study's \"extravagant claims are based on errors of mathematical logic\". The logic of his paper has in turn been criticized by the authors of the original paper. <SPAN class=\"mw",

Thereafter, in 1940, the American acoustical physicist Floyd Firestone devised the first ultrasonic echo imaging device, the Supersonic Reflectoscope, to detect internal flaws in metal castings. In 1941, the Austrian neurologist Karl Theo Dussik was in collaboration with his brother, Friedreich, a physicist, likely, the first person to ultrasonically echo image the human body, outlining thereby the ventricles of a human brain. Ultrasonic energy was first applied to the human body for medical purposes by Dr George Ludwig at the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland in the late 1940s. English-born physicist John Wild (1914\u20132009) first used ultrasound to assess the thickness of bowel tissue as early as 1949; he has been described as the \"father of medical ultrasound\". Subsequent advances in the field took place concurrently in several countries.

After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates only. One account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup with Page and Beck would go down like a \"lead balloon\", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in lead at the suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant , so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it \"leed\". The word \"balloon\" was replaced by \" zeppelin \", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick, brought \"the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace\" to Page's mind.

    "question": "why is the nuclues called the control center of the cell",
    "long_answer": "Cell nuclei contain most of the cell's genetic material , organized as multiple long linear DNA molecules in complex with a large variety of proteins , such as histones , to form chromosomes . The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome and are structured in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression \u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope , a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm , and the nuclear matrix (which includes the nuclear lamina ), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton , which supports the cell as a whole. <",

She met Vincent van Gogh when she was 12 or 13. She received news media attention in 1985, after turning 110. Subsequent investigation found documentation for Calment's age, beyond any reasonable question, in the records of her native city, Arles , France. More evidence of Calment's lifespan has been produced than for any other supercentenarian; her case serves as an archetype in the methodology for verifying the ages of the world's oldest people. <",

    "question": "why is crop rotation considered a good agricultural practice",
    "long_answer": "Growing the same crop in the same place for many years in a row ( monocropping ) disproportionately depletes the soil of certain nutrients . With rotation, a crop that leaches the soil of one kind of nutrient is followed during the next growing season by a dissimilar crop that returns that nutrient to the soil or draws a different ratio of nutrients. In addition, crop rotation mitigates the buildup of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped, and can also improve soil structure and fertility by increasing biomass from varied root structures.",

    "question": "how many atp molecules are produced during the electron transport chain",
    "long_answer": "2 is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the \"terminal electron acceptor\". Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane. This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group. Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (2 from glycolysis, 2 from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport system). However, this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix, and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.

    "question": "do volcanoes usually form at convergent continental/continental boundaries",
    "long_answer": "oceanic trench is found where the denser plate is subducted underneath the other plate. There is water in the rocks of the oceanic plate (because they are underwater), and as this plate moves further down into the subduction zone, much of the water contained in the plate is squeezed out when the plate begins to subduct. However, the recrystallization of ocean floor rocks, such as serpentinite , which are unstable in the upper mantle, recrystallize into olivine , causing dehydration through loss of hydroxyl groups . This addition of water to the mantle causes partial melting of the mantle, generating magma, which then rises, and which normally results in volcanoes. This normally happens at a certain depth, about 70 to 80 miles below the Earth's surface, and so volcanoes are formed fairly close to, but not right next to, the trench. <SP",

    "question": "what was the main advantage of the bottle-shape of the dahlgren gun",
    "long_answer": "Dahlgren guns were muzzle-loading naval artillery designed by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren USN (November 13, 1809 \u2013 July 12, 1870), mostly used in the period of the American Civil War . Dahlgren's design philosophy evolved from an accidental explosion in 1849 of a 32-pounder being tested for accuracy, killing a gunner. He believed a safer, more powerful naval cannon could be designed using more scientific design criteria. Dahlgren guns were designed with a smooth curved shape, equalizing strain and concentrating more weight of metal in the gun breech where the greatest pressure of expanding propellant gases needed to be met to keep the gun from bursting. Because of their rounded contours, Dahlgren guns were nicknamed \"soda bottles\", a shape which became their most identifiable characteristic. <",

February 19, 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender ( \u30e9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0 , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match.

February 26, 2017 TBA As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that l",

    "question": "where did the name zion national park come from",
    "long_answer": "habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans , one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (500 CE) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service , Horace Albright , drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, a name used by the Mormons. According to historian Hal Rothman : \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it. The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\" On November 20, 1919, the United States Congress established the monument as Zion National Park, and it was signed by President Woodrow Wilson . The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the park in 1956. The <A href=\"/wiki/Geology_of_the_Zion_and",

MLB does not have a hard salary cap , instead employing a luxury tax which applies to teams whose total payroll exceeds certain set thresholds for a given season. Free agency did not exist in MLB prior to the end of the reserve clause in the 1970s, allowing owners before that time to wholly dictate the terms of player negotiations and resulting in significantly lower salaries. Babe Ruth , widely regarded as one of the greatest baseball players ever, earned an estimated $910,696 ($14,654,832 inflation-adjusted from 1931 dollars) over his entire playing career. When asked whether he thought he deserved to earn $80,000 a year ($1,171,952 inflation-adjusted), while the president , Herbert Hoover , had a $75,000 salary, Ruth famously remarked, \"What the hell has Hoover got to do with it?

    "long_answer": "solid-state physics , the valence band and conduction band are the bands closest to the Fermi level and thus determine the electrical conductivity of the solid. In non-metals, the valence band is the highest range of electron energies in which electrons are normally present at absolute zero temperature, while the conduction band is the lowest range of vacant electronic states . On a graph of the electronic band structure of a material, the valence band is located below the Fermi level, while the conduction band is located above it. This distinction is meaningless in metals where conduction occurs in one or more partially filled bands, taking on the properties of both the valence and conduction bands. <DI",

One particular cellular barrier that may prevent absorption of a given drug is the cell membrane . Cell membranes are essentially lipid bilayers which form a semipermeable membrane . Pure lipid bilayers are generally permeable only to small, uncharged solutes. Hence, whether or not a molecule is ionized will affect its absorption, since ionic molecules are charged.

The revised model, officially called the PCH-2000 series and commonly referred to as the PS Vita Slim, is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model. While it largely maintains the original's overall structure and layout, the original's OLED screen has been replaced with a lower-cost LCD display. The model also roughly added about an extra hour of battery life. The newer model also comes with 1 GB of internal storage memory, although it is not possible to use both the internal memory and memory card concurrently. Upon inserting a PS Vita memory card, the system will offer to copy the existing data from the internal memory to the new card. This model has a micro USB Type B port, which can be used to charge the device along with any standard micro USB cable. The model was released in six colors in Japan (white, black, light blue, lime green, pink, and khaki), although it was only released in black and light blue in North America and Europe.

It resulted in the United States federal government pulling the last troops out of the South, and formally ended the Reconstruction Era . Through the Compromise, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes was awarded the White House over Democrat Samuel J. Tilden on the understanding that Hayes would remove the federal troops whose support was essential for the survival of Republican state governments in South Carolina , Florida and Louisiana . The compromise involved Democrats who controlled the House of Representatives allowing the decision of the Electoral Commission to take effect. The outgoing president, Republican Ulysses S. Grant , removed the soldiers from Florida. As president, Hayes removed the remaining troops from South Carolina and Louisiana. As soon as the troops left, many white Republicans also left, and the \" Redeemer \" Democrats took control. They already dominated most other state governments in the South.

But 1995 would bring a pause in economic growth, primarily because the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from 3% to 6% beginning in late-1994 to prevent inflation from rising after such rapid growth along with two government shutdowns that slowed the economy. The pause was short-lived, however, as the economy adjusted and the surge of investment in the Dot-Com bubble would jumpstart the economy beginning in late-1995. 1996 saw a return to steady growth, and in May 1997 unemployment fell below 5% for the first time since December 1973. <",

Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853. In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\". Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre , the head of company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments. <A href=\"/",

Over time, some disputed books , such as the Book of Revelation and the Minor Catholic (General) Epistles were introduced into canons in which they were originally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as 1 Clement , the Shepherd of Hermas , and the Diatessaron , were excluded from the New Testament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including Roman Catholics , Protestants , the Greek Orthodox Church , the Slavic Orthodox Churches , and the Armenian Orthodox Church .

    "long_answer": "[60] When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; the reasons for this are the subject of debate. The Sun is a G2V star, with G2 indicating its surface temperature of approximately 5,778 K (5,505 \u00b0C, 9,941 \u00b0F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star. The average luminance of the Sun is about 1.88 giga candela per square metre , but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44 Gcd/m .

The Germans were unable to repel either of the advances on the two fronts and eventually lost the war. While there were other contributing factors, such as the insufficiency of the Wehrmacht for a long war and the abandonment of blitzkrieg tactics because of fuel shortages and a rising need to defend territory, the two-front war was an important factor in deciding when the German military would be forced to surrender. <P",

The purpose of the urinary system is to eliminate waste from the body, regulate blood volume and blood pressure, control levels of electrolytes and metabolites, and regulate blood pH. The urinary tract is the body's drainage system for the eventual removal of urine. The kidneys have an extensive blood supply via the renal arteries which leave the kidneys via the renal vein. Each kidney consists of functional units called nephrons . Following filtration of blood and further processing, wastes (in the form of urine ) exit the kidney via the ureters, tubes made of smooth muscle fibres that propel urine towards the urinary bladder, where it is stored and subsequently expelled from the body by urination ( voiding ). The female and male urinary system are very similar, differing only in the length of the urethra.",

A two-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value may be more than or less than the reference value, for example, whether a test taker may score above or below the historical average. A one-tailed test is appropriate if the estimated value may depart from the reference value in only one direction, for example, whether a machine produces more than one-percent defective products. Alternative names are one-sided and two-sided tests; the terminology \"tail\" is used because the extreme portions of distributions, where observations lead to rejection of the null hypothesis , are small and often \"tail off\" toward zero as in the normal distribution or \"bell curve\", pictured on the right.",

In the liver, glycogen can make up from 5\u20136% of the organ's fresh weight and the liver of an adult weighing 70 kg can store roughly 100\u2013120 grams of glycogen. In skeletal muscle, glycogen is found in a low concentration (1\u20132% of the muscle mass) and the skeletal muscle of an adult weighing 70 kg can store roughly 400 grams of glycogen. The amount of glycogen stored in the body\u2014particularly within the muscles and liver\u2014mostly depends on physical training, basal metabolic rate , and eating habits. Small amounts of glycogen are also found in other tissues and cells, including the kidneys , red blood cells , white blood cells , and glial cells in the brain .

Following the merger in 1970, the Super Bowl name continued as the game to determine the NFL champion. The most important factor of the merger was that all ten AFL teams joined the NFL in 1970 and every AFL championship game and record is included in NFL record books. The old NFL Championship Game became the NFC Championship Game , while the old AFL Championship Game became the AFC Championship Game . The NFL lists the old AFL/NFL championship games with \"new\" AFC/NFC championship games in its record books. The Green Bay Packers have won the most championships with 13 total (9 NFL championships pre-merger, four (4) Super Bowl championships). The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive championships, having done so twice (1929\u20131931, 1965\u20131967).

The pillar, sometimes called the A\u015boka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the Sarnath Museum , in the state of Uttar Pradesh , India . Standing 2.15 metres (7 feet) high including the base, it is more elaborate than the other very similar surviving capitals of the pillars of Ashoka bearing the Edicts of Ashoka that were placed throughout India several of which feature single animals at the top; one other damaged group of four lions survives, at Sanchi . <",

    "long_answer": "Polonius , Claudius recruits Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to escort Hamlet to England, providing them with a letter for the King of England instructing him to have Hamlet killed. (They are apparently unaware of what is in the letter, though Shakespeare never explicitly says so.) Along the journey, the distrustful Hamlet finds and rewrites the letter, instructing the executioner to kill Rosencrantz and Guildenstern instead. When their ship is attacked by pirates, Hamlet returns to Denmark, leaving Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to die; he comments in Act V , Scene 2 that \"They are not near my conscience; their defeat / Does by their own insinuation grow\". Ambassadors returning later report that \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.\"",

On the one hand, bearing false witness (perjury) was always prohibited according to the decalogue 's commandement against bearing false witness, yet on the other hand, lying in general was acknowledged to be, in certain circumstances \"permissible or even commendable\" when it was a white lie , and it was done while not under oath, and it was not \"harmful to someone else\".",

Before their match could begin, a brawl broke out between the five and the match never occurred. McMahon then scheduled the five to compete in the first-ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match at the event where the winner would receive a contract for a SmackDown Women's Championship match. Carmella won the match after James Ellsworth retrieved the briefcase, and threw it to her. On the following episode of SmackDown Live , however, SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan forced Carmella to relinquish the briefcase since Ellsworth retrieved it for her. On that same episode, Bryan also scheduled a Money in the Bank ladder match rematch for the June 27 episode with Ellsworth banned from ringside (later from the arena).

Timon was portrayed through his many appearances by Nathan Lane (in all three films and early episodes of the show), Max Casella (the original actor in The Lion King Broadway musical ), Kevin Schon (in certain episodes of the show), Quinton Flynn (in certain episodes of the show), Bruce Lanoil in the Wild About Safety shorts and Kingdom Hearts II , and while Pumbaa is voiced by Ernie Sabella (in all of his animated speaking appearances), and was portrayed by Tom Alan Robbins in the original cast of the Broadway musical.

Lyricist Tim Rice however was pulling for Rik Mayall (for Timon) and Adrian Edmondson (for Pumbaa) to play the roles, as he got the idea for the lyrics to \" Hakuna Matata \" by watching their show Bottom .",

    "long_answer": "James Beard 's reference, American Cookery (1972), describes three red velvet cakes varying in the amounts of shortening , butter , and vegetable oil . All used red food coloring. The reaction of acidic vinegar and buttermilk tends to better reveal the red anthocyanin in cocoa and keeps the cake moist, light, and fluffy. This natural tinting may have been the source for the name \"red velvet\", as well as \" Devil's food \" and similar names for chocolate cakes. Contemporarily, chocolate has often undergone Dutch processing , which prevents the color change of the anthocyanins. A reconstruction of the original red velvet cake involves reducing or eliminating the vinegar and colorants, and using a non- Dutched cocoa to provide the needed acidity and color.",

    "question": "what are the sacraments at the service of communion",
    "long_answer": "Blessed Sacrament , is the sacrament (the third of Christian initiation, the one that the Catechism of the Catholic Church says \"completes Christian initiation\") by which Catholics partake of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ and participate in his one sacrifice. The first of these two aspects of the sacrament is also called Holy Communion. The bread (which must be wheaten, and which is unleavened in the Latin, Armenian and Ethiopic Rites, but is leavened in most Eastern Rites) and wine (which must be from grapes) used in the Eucharistic rite are, in Catholic faith, transformed in their inner reality, though not in appearance, into the Body and Blood of Christ, a change that is called transubstantiation . \"The minister who is able to confect the sacrament of the Eucharist in the person of Christ is a validly ordained priest alone.\" The word \"priest\" here (in Latin sacerdos ) includes both bishops and those priests who are also called presbyters . Deacons as well as priests ( sacerdotes ) are ordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and lay people may be authorized in limited circumstances to act as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion. The Eucharist is seen as \"the source and summit\" of Christian living, the high point of God's sanctifying action on the faithful and of their worship of God, the point of contact between them and the liturgy of heaven. So important is it that participation in the Eucharistic celebration (see Mass ) is seen as obligatory on every Sunday and holy day of obligation and is recommended on other days. Also recommended for those who participate in the Mass is reception, with the proper dispositions, of Holy Communion. This is seen as obligatory at least once a year, during Eastertide. <SPAN class=\"mw-",

    "long_answer": "[17] By February 1865 the area was incorporated officially as \"Town of Lake\" the area still consisted of fewer than 700 persons. In the early 1860s the meat packing industry of the United States was still located in Cincinnati, Ohio, the original \"Porkopolis\" of the pre-Civil War era. However, with the end of the American Civil War, the meat packing industry had started to move westward along with the westward migration of the population of the United States. For the meat packing industry moving west meant coming to Chicago. As early as 1827, Archibauld Clybourn had established himself as a butcher in a log slaughter house on the north branch of the Chicago River and supplied most to the garrison of Fort Dearborn. Other small butchers came later. In 1848, the Bull's Head Stockyard began operations at Madison Street and Ogden Avenue on the West Side of Chicago. Operations for this early stockyard, however, still meant holding and feeding cattle and hogs in transit to meat packing plants further east\u2014Indianapolis and, of course, Cincinnati. <SPAN cl",

However, almost six decades after commercial nuclear energy began, no government has succeeded in opening such a repository for civilian high-level nuclear waste, although Finland is in the advanced stage of the construction of such facility, the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository . Reprocessing or recycling spent nuclear fuel options already available or under active development still generate waste and so are not a total solution, but can reduce the sheer quantity of waste, and there are many such active programs worldwide.

    "long_answer": "fish swim through water by creating undulations with their bodies or oscillating their fins . The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a rearward force, side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies. Eel-shaped fish undulate their entire body in rhythmic sequences. Streamlined fish, such as salmon, undulate the caudal portions of their bodies. Some fish, such as sharks, use stiff, strong fins to create dynamic lift and propel themselves. It is common for fish to use more than one form of propulsion, although they will display one dominant mode of swimming Gait changes have even been observed in juvenile reef fish of various sizes.

Then, a TV network broadcasts the \"Walk-A-Thon\" events, where both teams also become incapacitated, because of the SPS, so they all end up in hospital and have their pants cut off, much to Tawni's dismay. Later that day, Tawni is given the balloon pants, a medicine that she has to wear until her legs are healed. Tawni becomes fed up with her balloon pants, and she tries to wear the skinny jeans, only to learn that all her fans also suffered SPS, so Tawni and everyone decide to make charity music video \"Stop SPS\", in order to fight against SPS. So Random! sketches: \"Sicky Vicky\": Sonny plays Vicky, a sick girl who hosts a TV show from her bed giving tips about fun things to do when you are sick. Untitled Hula Sketch: The cast rehearses a hula sketch. \"Stop SPS\": The casts of So Random! and Mackenzie Falls unite to film the music video to stop Skinny Pants Syndrome. Absent: Allisyn Ashley Arm as Zora Note: On this episode's first broadcast, the 16:9 widescreen picture seen on Disney Channel HD was mistakenly compressed into the 4:3 center cut picture on Disney Channel's SD feed; the rebroadcast on March 21, 2010 corrected this. This is the first episode broadcast that was taped at Hollywood Center Studios , joining Wizards of Waverly Place , The Suite Life on Deck and Jonas at the lot; the series was shot at NBC Studios in Burbank for the first season. The series' record breaking season premiere was led in by the season finale for Hannah Montana , which topped the week with 7.6 million viewers. 23 2 \"Sonny Get Your Goat\" Eric Dean Seaton Dava Savel March 21, 2010 ( 2010-03-21 ) 204 3.2 Sonny and Tawni are invited on an exchange program to Glendovia because of the success of their \"Check-it-Out Girls\" sketch, but refuse to go together due to an unknown argument.

States that have passed right-to-work laws go further by not allowing employers to require employees to pay the agency fee. An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it, within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, while a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, it cannot demand that an employer fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay those dues that are uniformly required of all employees.

Two events separated by seven years have become fused, but although neither is likely to be provable, such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible. Various web sites offer variations on the elephant\u2019s foot story, a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru-Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company (AR&TC) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm\u2019s feet smelled of oil. Retracing the trail of footprints, they found oil seeping to the surface. One of the engineers, the Englishman Willie Leova Lake, was an \u2018oil enthusiast\u2019 and persuaded the company to drill a well. Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants\u2019 feet in its company history, although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed \"the oil seepages around Borbhil\". Once the project had been approved, Lake assembled equipment, boilers, and local labour, and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site. The first well was started in September 1889, but an encouraging first strike at 178 feet (54 m) turned out to be a small pocket, and drilling recommenced. This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 feet (202 m), and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to \"Dig, boy!\" Digboi as",

    "long_answer": "Match Day is a term used widely in the graduate medical education community to represent the day when the National Resident Matching Program or NRMP releases results to applicants seeking residency and fellowship training positions in the United States. Match Day for the NRMP Main Residency Match is on the third Friday of March each year, and Match Day ceremonies occur at many of the 155 medical schools in the United States where those results are announced. Match Days for the NRMP Fellowship Matches occur throughout the year because each Fellowship Match has its own schedule of dates. Other national matching plans like the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), American Urological Association, and the San Francisco Match (Ophthalmology) have dates on which they release their results. By participating in a national matching plan, applicants contractually agree to attend the residency , internship or fellowship programs to which they match. The same agreement applies to the programs; they are obligated to train the applicants who match to them. In 2017, Match Day hit a record-high as 35,969 U.S. and international medical school students and graduates vied for 31,757 residency positions.",

The company took the name of the chief mate in the book Moby-Dick : Starbuck, after considering \"Cargo House\" and \" Pequod \". Bowker recalls that Terry Heckler, with whom Bowker owned an advertising agency, thought words beginning with \"st\" were powerful. The founders brainstormed a list of words beginning with \"st\". Someone pulled out an old mining map of the Cascade Range and saw a mining town named \"Starbo\", which immediately put Bowker in mind of the character \"Starbuck\".

Electricity from the dam also enabled the building of many new hotels along the Strip.

Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe. Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.",
