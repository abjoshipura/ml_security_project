    "long_answer": "\"Wealth\" , more commonly known as \"The Gospel of Wealth\" , is an article written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self-made rich . Carnegie proposed to his wife using the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to redistribute their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner. This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest (patrimony), where wealth is handed down to heirs, and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes. Carnegie argued that poor people put to best use (i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society) when it is administered carefully by the poor. Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance, irresponsible spending, or self-indulgence, instead promoting the administration of said capital over the course of one's lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor. As a result, the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages \"the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy\".",

Jack Frost is a teenage hellion who enjoys creating mischief and has no interest in being bound by rules or obligations; he just wants to use his staff to spread his winter magic for the sake of fun, but also wants to be believed in. At the end of the film, Jack became the Guardian of Fun. While he cannot fly, per se, he can be carried on currents of wind, allowing him to span great distances.

Isla Fisher as Tooth ( Tooth Fairy ), the mythical tooth collector and the Guardian of Memories. Tooth is part human and part hummingbird . Assisted by mini fairies that are split-off extensions of herself, she collects the children's teeth, which hold their most precious memories. Tooth stores them in her palace and returns memories when they are needed the most. She seems to have a crush on Jack, (or more acurately, his pure white teeth). Jude Law as Pitch Black ( The Boogeyman ), the essence of fear and the Nightmare King. Dakota Goyo as Jamie Bennett, a child who has not given up on believing in the Guardians.

In the brief audio recording, 53% of over 500,000 people answered on a Twitter poll that they heard a man saying the original word \"Laurel\", while 47% reported hearing a voice saying the name \"Yanny\". Analysis of the sound frequencies has confirmed that both sets of sounds are present in the mixed recording, but some users focus on the higher frequency sounds in \"Yanny\" and cannot seem to hear the lower sounds of the word \"Laurel\". When the audio clip has been slowed to lower frequencies, then the word \"Yanny\" has been heard by more listeners, while faster playback loudens \"Laurel\" (see below: Pitch-shifted versions ).",

It is described in the Book of Numbers as arriving with the dew during the night. Exodus adds that manna was comparable to hoarfrost in color, similarly had to be collected before it was melted by the heat of the sun, and was like a coriander seed in size but white in color. Numbers describes it as having the appearance of bdellium , adding that the Israelites ground it and pounded it into cakes, which were then baked, resulting in something that tasted like cakes baked with oil. Exodus states that raw manna tasted like wafers that had been made with honey. The Israelites were instructed to eat only the manna they had gathered for each day. Stored manna \"bred worms and stank\": the exception being that stored the day before the Sabbath (Preparation Day), when twice the amount of manna was gathered.

Diarist Thomas Raikes later recounted that \"No event ever produced so great a sensation in English society as the introduction of the waltz in 1813\". In the same year, a sardonic tribute to the dance by Lord Byron was anonymously published (written the previous autumn). Influential dance master and author of instruction manuals, Thomas Wilson published A Description of the Correct Method of Waltzing in 1816. Almack's , the most exclusive club in London, permitted the waltz though the entry in the Oxford English Dictionary shows that it was considered \"riotous and indecent\" as late as 1825. Ann Bronte in 'The Tenant of Wildfell Hall' has a scene set in 1827 where the local vicar Reverend Milward tolerates quadrilles and country dances but intervenes decisively when a waltz is called for, declaring \"No, no, I don't allow that!

    "question": "when does mark show up in grey anatomy",
    "long_answer": "season two , introduced as a highly respected otolaryngologist sub-specialized in plastic surgery and the childhood best friend of neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ). Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife, Addison ( Kate Walsh ) while they were living in New York . Mark travels to Seattle , intent on convincing Addison to return with him, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship. Mark returns during season three at Addison's drunken behest, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred, Mark sells his successful private practice (which he previously shared with Derek) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During Meredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek's friendship back. It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek's sisters. Mark has a brief fling with Addison's friend, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ), and develops a friendship with Derek's girlfriend, intern Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ). It is revealed that after Derek left New York, Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months, during which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time, Addison will give their relationship another chance. Addison ultimately breaks the pact by having sex with intern Alex Karev ( Justin Chambers ), and soon thereafter departs from Seattle to work in Los Angeles . Ma",

In 1893 , the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920. The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as Robison Field . Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the St. Louis Browns . In 1953, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for Baltimore after the season. The Cardinals built Busch Memorial Stadium , or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005. It was built as the multi-purpose stadium home of both the baseball Cardinals and the NFL football Cardinals , who are now the Arizona Cardinals . The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. Spring training [ <A",

In the Southern Professional Hockey League , regular season overtime periods are played three on three for one five-minute period, with penalties resulting in the opponents skating one additional player on ice (up to two additional players) for the penalty for the first three minutes, and a penalty shot in the final two minutes. The AHL, since the 2014\u201315 season , extended the overtime to seven minutes, with the last three minutes reduced further to three men aside and teams getting an additional skater for each opponent's penalty.

In 1570 Pope Pius V responded, in his bull Regnans in Excelsis , calling on all Catholics to rebel against Elizabeth and excommunicating anyone who obeyed her. The Parliament of England made the fact of being a Jesuit or seminarian treasonable in 1571. Priests found celebrating Mass were often hanged, drawn and quartered , rather than being burned at the stake. The Catholic Church (along with other non-established churches) continued in England, although it was at times subject to various forms of persecution. Most recusant members (except those in diaspora on the Continent , in heavily Catholic areas in the north, or part of the aristocracy) practised their faith in private for all practical purposes. In 1766, the Pope recognised the English Monarchy as lawful, and this led eventually to the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 . Dioceses (replacing districts) were re-established by Pope Pius IX in 1850. Along with the 22 Latin Rite dioceses, there are the Eastern Catholic diocese of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Holy Family of London and the Syro-Malabar Catholic Eparchy of Great Britain . <",

    "long_answer": "British history covers the brief reign of King Edward VII , 1901 to 1910, and is sometimes extended in both directions to capture long-term trends from the 1890s to the First World War . The death of Queen Victoria in January 1901 marked the end of the Victorian era . The new king Edward VII was already the leader of a fashionable elite that set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europe. Samuel Hynes described the Edwardian era as a \"leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun really never set on the British flag'\". The Liberals returned to power in 1906 and made significant reforms . Below the upper class, the era was marked by significant shifts in politics among sections of society that were largely excluded from wielding power in the past, such as common labourers. Women became increasingly politicised. <DIV class=\"toctit",

    "question": "coriolosis component of acceleration can be found in",
    "long_answer": "In popular (non-technical) usage of the term \"Coriolis effect\", the rotating reference frame implied is almost always the Earth . Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need to account for the Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects. The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere . The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the poles , since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the equator . Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology ).",

His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense. The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features. His plots were carefully constructed, and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers. Dickens",

Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright (the dead man's wife) twenty years prior. Once the whole group is safely inside the house, Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior. Despite the serious circumstances, he delivers his story in a long-winded and poorly thought-out manner, tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout. The story begins with Mr. Hale venturing to Mr. Wright's house to convince Wright to get a telephone. Upon entering the house, he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled. The women's curious nature and very peculiar attention to minute details allows them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright's guilt and of her provocations and motives. Meanwhile, the men are unable to procure any evidence. The women find the one usable piece of evidence: the dead bird in the box. It's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her. But now finding her bird is dead, with a broken neck (with the implication that the husband killed it) it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two \"midwestern rural women\" to understand Mrs. Wright's suffering when the only living thing around her has died. The women find justification in Mrs. Wright\u2019s actions and go about hiding what they find from the men. In the end, their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction. The story ends here, and does not move into the occurrences after they leave the house. <",

On May 31, 1924, the two governments signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations, while the Soviet government renounced in that agreement all privileges granted to the Tsarist government in China. But in 1926 KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, after the conclusion of the Northern Expedition , Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the Chinese Civil War which would last until 1949, a few months after the proclamation of the People's Republic of China , led by Mao Zedong . During the war the Soviets gave some support to the CCP, which in 1934 suffered a crushing blow when the KMT brought an end to the Chinese Soviet Republic , thus causing the CCP's Long March from Shaanxi .

The word \"atom\" was coined by the ancient Greek philosophers Leucippus and his pupil Democritus . However, these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation. Because of this, they could not convince everybody, so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter. It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists, as the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that could easily be explained using the concept of atoms. <",

    "long_answer": "The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood\u2013brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS. The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic .",

While exploring the ruins, Klaus finds a broken spyglass with an insignia of an eye embedded on the front. Shortly afterwards, they are sent to live with their distant relative Count Olaf, a cruel and vain amateur actor, who forces them into servitude. One night, the siblings prepare puttanesca for Olaf's theatre troupe only for him to demand roast beef upon arriving home. The children state that they were never asked to prepare roast beef, angering Olaf and prompting him to slap Klaus across the face when he protests about the sleeping arrangements. Meanwhile, a mother and father are held against their will by a mysterious captor. 2 2 \"The Bad Beginning: Part Two\" Barry Sonnenfeld Daniel Handler January 13, 2017 ( 2017-01-13 ) The Baudelaires attempt to convince Mr. Poe of Olaf's actions, only to be sent away when Poe dismisses their claims. When Olaf gives Violet the starring role in his latest theatrical production, which ends with the two main characters being married, the siblings realize that Olaf intends to acquire their fortune by marrying Violet for real. Klaus confronts Olaf, who threatens to kill Sunny if Violet doesn't follow through with his plans. At the very last minute, however, Violet signs the marriage certificate with her left hand, invalidating the proceedings due to the fact that she is right-handed. Mr. Poe's mysterious secretary Jacquelyn reveals they were intended to be put in the care of their distant relative Montgomery Montgomery. Meanwhile, Jacquelyn's ally Gustav is mysteriously drowned, after being hit by a poisoned dart. 3 3 \"The Reptile Room: Part One\" Mark Palansky Daniel Handler January 13, 2017 ( 2017-01-13 ) The Baudelaires are sent to live with their herpetologist uncle Montgomery Montgomery, who has recently come across a reptile he calls the Incredibly Deadly Viper. While attempting to learn more about Montgomery, Klaus discovers that the hedge maze in Montgomery's garden is exactly the same shape as the tattoo on Olaf's ankle. Olaf poses as Montgomery's new assistant Stephano and attempts to kidnap the Baudelaires, but Monty assures the Baudelaires that he recognizes Stephano as a threat. The four arrive at a movie theatre, where Monty deciphers a code sent for him through the subtitles of the film, using a spyglass identical to Klaus'. The message instructs him to bring the children to Peru.

    "question": "when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations",
    "long_answer": "United States Department of Defense discontinued the inclusion of cigarettes in K-rations and C-rations . By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47%) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30%) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger , who announced, \"an intense anti-smoking campaign\u2026at all levels of all Services.\" It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52% to 25% by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) became the first smoke-free Navy ship. By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42% and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9% from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing. <SPAN i",

From the Late Paleozoic to Early Mesozoic eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent Pangaea , with Eurasia to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the Appalachian Mountains , which formed some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago, North America became part of Laurasia , before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid- Cretaceous period. The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the Laramide orogeny , between 80 and 55 million years ago. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago, and the Great Lakes (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris , asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned, sparking the idiom \"don't fly too close to the sun\" .

An attempt by U.S. President James Buchanan to reinforce and resupply Anderson using the unarmed merchant ship Star of the West failed when it was fired upon by shore batteries on January 9, 1861. South Carolina authorities then seized all Federal property in the Charleston area except for Fort Sumter. During the early months of 1861, the situation",

Because the song was set to be released around the same time as the film and the two were remarkably similar in story line, Moore felt that \"Cry\" would be perfect to be included in the film's soundtrack. The song is one of Moore's favorites on the album. Moore stated in a Billboard interview that she carried around a copy of the song for over a year before she recorded it. \"It felt like my ace in the hole. It's such a beautiful song on every level. I couldn't wait to get into the studio and sing it.\" She added that James Renald , the writer and producer of the song, had to \"peel her out of the booth because she wanted to sing it over and over again.\" <",

In a 2011 interview, Leung said her fondest memory of the Harry Potter experience was the first audition, because both her parents, who were separated at the time, went with her. \"It was a really nice moment because my parents hadn't seen each other for a long, long time,\" Leung said.

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , with Death-Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is renamed the Dark Arts , and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions. The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members\u2014throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject. During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ), Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ), Remus Lupin ( book three ), Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor \"Mad-eye\" Moody ( book four ), Dolores Umbridge ( book five ), Severus Snape ( book six ), and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ). Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that \"They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now.\" In Half-Blood Prince , Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected. The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half-Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards.

    "question": "who wrote when you and i were young maggie",
    "long_answer": "\" When You and I Were Young, Maggie \" is a famous folk song , popular song and standard . Though Springtown, Tennessee, has a small monument outside an old mill claiming the song was written by a local George Johnson, in 1864, for his Maggie, the truth is that its lyrics were written as a poem by the Canadian school teacher George Washington Johnson from Hamilton, Ontario. Margaret \"Maggie\" Clark was his pupil. They fell in love and during a period of illness, George walked to the edge of the Niagara escarpment, overlooking what is now downtown Hamilton, and composed the poem. The general tone is perhaps one of melancholy and consolation over lost youth rather than mere sentimentality or a fear of aging. It was published in 1864 in a collection of his poems entitled Maple Leaves . They were married in 1864 but Maggie's health deteriorated and she died on May 12, 1865. James Austin Butterfield set the poem to music and it became popular all over the world. George Washington Johnson died in 1917. The schoolhouse where the two lovers met still stands on the escarpment above Hamilton, and a plaque bearing the name of the song has been erected in front of the old building. In 2005, the song was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.",

Thus Yuan orders that the inventor shall be executed because, while his flying machine may be a beautiful creation, the emperor sees the devastating potential for those who \"have an evil face and an evil heart\" and will seek to use it for purposes other than the enjoyment of flight, namely flying over the Great Wall of China (which he himself created) and destroying it.

But in the last line the Emperor mourns the loss of the machine, the marvel of which he appreciates but the danger of which is too great to allow its survival.

Simonds October 3, 2008 ( 2008-10-03 ) 9.44 Melinda hears that there has been a fire at the Rockland University Building when Jim is called over there, and hurries over, fearful for Professor Rick Payne, but he is revealed to be alive and well. However, a therapist by the name Eli James dies, and Melinda witnesses his soul being brought back. This 'near-death' experience grants him the ability to hear ghosts. The episode is focused on the ghost of one of Eli's patients, who was possibly more than that, and whether or not she has been starting fires since she was 12. Whilst Melinda is trapped in the archives, she meets a group of seemingly benign ghosts calling themselves the watchers, who warn her that dealing with death may brush off on something she loves. Note: This was Jay Mohr's last appearance as Professor Payne.

She remembers Melinda's abilities from high school (not that she ever believed it before) and calls on her for help. Mel quickly uncovers the story-Grace, her current boyfriend and the dead friend were in a car accident with a motorcyclist 10 years ago and they left him for dead. The guilt ate away at the dead friend but when he tried to go to the police, the other two stopped him. Melinda must tell the motorcyclists family what happened to him in order for the ghost to move on. 65 3 \"Ghost in the Machine\" Steven Robman Jeannine Renshaw October 17, 2008 ( 2008-10-17 ) 8.97 Melinda watches Ned playing a computer game, and notices one of the Avatars staring right at her, and he appears in her shop, making her realise she has pulled him out of the game. She realises he is a ghost who appears as his Avatar because that is how he remembers himself, he died whilst playing the game. After realising that this Ghost/Avatar-'Phoenix' is usually hanging around with a teenage girl in the game, Mel, Ned and Eli suspect that he is a Predator, and proceed to try and catch him. Melinda sets up an Avatar and enters the game, and eventually discovers that 'Phoenix' is the girls dad, and is actually trying to protect his daughter from the real Predator, who they then have to work together to catch. 66 4 \"Save Our Souls\" Gloria Muzio Mark B.

The colliding body is sometimes called Theia , from the name of the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene , the goddess of the Moon. Analysis of lunar rocks, published in a 2016 report, suggests that the impact may have been a direct hit, causing a thorough mixing of both parent bodies.",

The first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single octet with the same binary value as ASCII, so that valid ASCII text is valid UTF-8-encoded Unicode as well. Since ASCII bytes do not occur when encoding non-ASCII code points into UTF-8, UTF-8 is safe to use within most programming and document languages that interpret certain ASCII characters in a special way, such as \" / \" in filenames, \" \\ \" in escape sequences , and \"%\" in printf . <D",

    "question": "who played lucky on king of the hill",
    "long_answer": "(voiced by Tom Petty ) \u2014 Lucky is Luanne's itinerant, but generally benign redneck husband, and is the father of Luanne's child. It is often hard for Lucky to hold down a job (he has no credit or Social Security number ). He lives on the remainder of the $53,000 \" settlement monies \" he received after \"slipping on pee-pee at the Costco \" having had a portion of his spine fused. He was nicknamed \"Lucky\" after the settlement windfall. After he spent a majority of his money customizing his truck, his finances dwindled down to nine thousand dollars but regained another $53,000 when an ambulance chasing lawyer paid off Lucky to avoid a lawsuit. Peggy tried very hard to break him and Luanne apart, but after Luanne's pregnancy was revealed, she and Hank reconciled the two, giving them a shotgun wedding at Lucky's request. He is also one of the guitarists for John Redcorn's band \"Big Mountain Fudgecake\". Although dimwitted in some aspects, Lucky has learned some facets such as basic math through life experience as opposed to formal education, and was astute enough to deduce that his father-in-law spent time in jail whereas Luanne believed the story that he works on an oil rig. He yearned to receive his GED but only to prove he was good enough to marry Luanne. Gracie Margaret Kleinschmidt \u2014",

Schneider has uttered the line \"You can do it!\" as a running gag in Sandler's films The Waterboy , Little Nicky , 50 First Dates , The Longest Yard , and Bedtime Stories , as well as in a deleted scene from Click . (A sample of Schneider saying the phrase also turns up in the song \" Original Prankster \" by The Offspring .) Returning the favor, Sandler appeared in a cameo to spout the same line in Schneider's The Animal , wherein, as a reference, Adam Sandler utters: \"Yeah!

At first, the angel is seen only by the donkey Balaam is riding, which tries to avoid the angel. After Balaam starts punishing the donkey for refusing to move, it is miraculously given the power to speak to Balaam (Numbers 22:28), and it complains about Balaam's treatment.

    "question": "what is the most selling movie of all time",
    "long_answer": "Avatar is often proclaimed to be the \"highest-grossing\" film, but such claims usually refer to theatrical revenues only and do not take into account home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. Titanic earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals, in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available for Avatar , it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America, and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide. After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion. Television broadcast rights will also substantially add to a film's earnings, with a film often earning as much as 20\u201325% of its theatrical box-office for a couple of television runs on top of pay-per-view revenues; Titanic earned a further $55 million from the NBC and HBO broadcast rights, equating to about 9% of its North American gross.

    "question": "where are the protons of the electron transport chain located",
    "long_answer": "chemiosmotic coupling hypothesis , proposed by Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner Peter D. Mitchell , the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation are coupled by a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The efflux of protons from the mitochondrial matrix creates an electrochemical gradient (proton gradient). This gradient is used by the F O F 1 ATP synthase complex to make ATP via oxidative phosphorylation. ATP synthase is sometimes described as Complex V of the electron transport chain. The F O component of ATP synthase acts as an ion channel that provides for a proton flux back into the mitochondrial matrix. It is composed of a, b and c subunits. Protons in the inter-membranous space of mitochondria first enters the ATP synthase complex through a subunit channel. Then protons move to the c subunits. The number of c subunits it has determines how many protons it will require to make the F O turn one full revolution. For example, in humans, there are 8 c subunits, thus 8 protons are required. After c subunits, protons finally enters matrix using a subunit channel that opens into the mitochondrial matrix. This reflux releases free energy produced during the generation of the oxidized forms of the electron carriers (NAD and Q). The free energy is used to drive ATP synthesis, catalyzed by the F 1 component of the complex. Coupling with oxidative phosphorylation is a key step for ATP production. However, in specific cases, uncoupling the two processes may be biologically useful. The uncoupling protein, thermogenin \u2014present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue \u2014provides for an alternative flow of protons back to the inner mitochondrial matrix. This alternative flow results in thermogenesis rather than ATP production. Synthetic uncouplers (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenol ) also exist, and, at high doses, are lethal. <SPAN class=\"mw-headli",

    "question": "where do the amino acids come from in protein synthesis",
    "long_answer": "In protein synthesis, a succession of tRNA molecules charged with appropriate amino acids are brought together with an mRNA molecule and matched up by base-pairing through the anti-codons of the tRNA with successive codons of the mRNA. The amino acids are then linked together to extend the growing protein chain, and the tRNAs, no longer carrying amino acids, are released. This whole complex of processes is carried out by the ribosome, formed of two main chains of RNA, called ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ), and more than 50 different proteins. The ribosome latches onto the end of an mRNA molecule and moves along it, capturing loaded tRNA molecules and joining together their amino acids to form a new protein chain.",

Named in honor of Graf (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin , the ship was launched on 8 December 1938, and was 85% complete by the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Graf Zeppelin was not completed and was never operational due to shifting construction priorities necessitated by the war. She remained in the Baltic for the duration of the war; with Germany's defeat imminent, the ship's custodian crew scuttled her just outside Stettin in March 1945. The Soviet Union raised the ship in March 1946, and she was ultimately sunk in weapons tests north of Poland 17 months later. The wreck was discovered by a Polish survey ship in July 2006. <IN",

    "long_answer": "; December 5, 1782 \u2013 July 24, 1862) was an American statesman who served as the eighth President of the United States from 1837 to 1841. A founder of the Democratic Party , he held a number of senior positions in the U.S. Federal Government , including eighth Vice President (1833\u20131837) and tenth Secretary of State (1829\u20131831), both under Andrew Jackson . Van Buren won the presidency by promising to continue Jackson's policies. The Panic of 1837 which struck the nation combined with the growing political strength of the opposition Whig Party led to his defeat when he ran for reelection. During his half-century of public service, he built and perfected a new system of political parties at first the state and then the federal level; at the end of his life, he was seen as a major figure of the abolitionist movement defending Abraham Lincoln 's policies during the American Civil War. Van Buren was the first President of the United States to be born a United States citizen . Of Dutch descent , he is the only U.S. President who spoke English as a second language .

    "long_answer": "cleanup hitter , also known as the cleanup spot and in modern baseball is almost always one of the best hitters on the team, often the one with the most power and ability to drive in runs with extra-base hits (double, triple, or home run). Baseball managers tend to place hitters who are most likely to reach base ahead of the clean-up man, so that the fourth batter can \"clean\" the bases by driving these baserunners home to score runs. His main goal is to drive in runs, although he is expected to score runs as well. Hitting cleanup requires an exceptional level of talent, and the ability to deliver big hits in important situations (such as the bases loaded with two out). Examples of #4 hitters include Lou Gehrig , Eddie Mathews , Willie McCovey , Billy Williams , Tony P\u00e9rez , Eddie Murray , Daniel Murphy , Alex Rodriguez , Prince Fielder , David Ortiz , Edgar Mart\u00ednez , and Ryan Howard .

In two earlier games at Hershey that season, Chamberlain had made a combined 27 of 38 free throws, 71 percent. The basket rims at the arena were aged, flimsy, and forgiving. Balls would bounce off of typical firm rims, whereas balls near the rim in Hershey were apt to get a good roll and fall in. Playing all 48 minutes of the game, Chamberlain set NBA records for field goals attempted (63) and made (36), free throws made (28), most points in a quarter (31), and half (59). He averaged 73 points in four games that week, exceeding 60 in all of them. Rodgers finished with a game-high 20 assists and later said:",

It premiered in the United States on September 13, 1996 in first-run syndication , but halted production in 1998 after two seasons. This was due to Saban scaling down its syndication operations, in order to focus on producing original material for the Fox Kids block. Pioneer also ceased its home video release of the series at volume 17 (the end of the dub) and retained the rights to produce an uncut subtitled version, but did not do so. <A href=\"/wiki/File:Christopher_Sabat_%26_Sean_",

    "long_answer": "Randy Quaid appeared in television commercials. In May 2015, KFC reprised the Colonel Sanders character in new television advertisements, played by comedian Darrell Hammond . Some commentators felt the new portrayal was distasteful and disrespectful of the actual man's legacy. In August 2015, KFC launched a new campaign, this time with comedian Norm Macdonald portraying Sanders; the first ad of the campaign makes direct reference to the Hammond campaign, with a brief piece of footage of Hammond followed by Macdonald's Colonel declaring his predecessor an impostor. In February 2016, yet another portrayal was introduced with Jim Gaffigan as the Colonel, shown bolting awake in bed and telling his wife about his recurring nightmare of Macdonald's Colonel \"pretending to be me\". By July 2016, George Hamilton was playing Colonel Sanders, parlaying his famous tan into an advertisement for KFC's \"extra crispy\" chicken. During the airing of the 2016 SummerSlam , a commercial aired of WWE wrestler Dolph Ziggler dressed up as Colonel Sanders beating up a man in a chicken suit (played by fellow wrestler The Miz ) in a wrestling ring. In September 2016 comedian Rob Riggle played Sanders in an ad introducing a football team named \"The Kentucky Buckets\". In January 2017, to advertise their \"Georgia Gold Honey Mustard BBQ\" Chicken offerings, actor Billy Zane took over the role as the \"Solid Gold Colonel\". In April 2017, actor Rob Lowe was announced as the newest actor in the role of Colonel Sanders. Lowe said that as a child, he actually got to meet Harland Sanders. WWE would return to using Colonel Sanders during 2017, showing ads of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle playing him, as well as announcing that Colonel Sanders would be available as a playable character in WWE 2K18 (accessible through the \"create-a-wrestler\" feature) as part of a product placement deal with KFC. Ray Liotta then portrayed Sanders, and singer Reba McEntire was named as the newest Sanders in January 2018. <SPAN class=\"mw-headline\" id",

Primordial nucleosynthesis is believed by most cosmologists to have taken place in the interval from roughly 10 seconds to 20 minutes after the Big Bang , and is calculated to be responsible for the formation of most of the universe's helium as the isotope helium-4 ( He), along with small amounts of the hydrogen isotope deuterium ( H or D), the helium isotope helium-3 ( He), and a very small amount of the lithium isotope lithium-7 ( Li). In addition to these stable nuclei, two unstable or radioactive isotopes were also produced: the heavy hydrogen isotope tritium ( H or T); and the beryllium isotope beryllium-7 ( Be); but these unstable isotopes later decayed into He and Li, as above.

    "long_answer": "The process of fermentation in winemaking turns grape juice into an alcoholic beverage . During fermentation, yeasts transform sugars present in the juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide (as a by-product ). In winemaking, the temperature and speed of fermentation are important considerations as well as the levels of oxygen present in the must at the start of the fermentation. The risk of stuck fermentation and the development of several wine faults can also occur during this stage, which can last anywhere from 5 to 14 days for primary fermentation and potentially another 5 to 10 days for a secondary fermentation . Fermentation may be done in stainless steel tanks, which is common with many white wines like Riesling , in an open wooden vat, inside a wine barrel and inside the wine bottle itself as in the production of many sparkling wines .",

It derives from the Pennsylvania Dutch superstition that if a groundhog ( Deitsch : Grundsau , Grunddax , Dax ) emerging from its burrow on this day sees a shadow due to clear weather, it will retreat to its den and winter will persist for six more weeks, and if it does not see its shadow because of cloudiness, spring will arrive early.

Will Poulter was previously cast in the role but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, with Poulter stating, \"I was when Mr. Fukunaga was directing, but the circumstances at New Line are such that a new director's attached now.\" Poulter continued, \"I think, with all due respect to him of course, I was selected by Cary and subscribed to Cary's vision for the movie, and so I haven't had a chance to connect with that [new] director.\" Mark Rylance , Ben Mendelsohn , Kirk Acevedo , Richard Armitage , Hugo Weaving , and Tilda Swinton were considered for the role, with Mendelsohn passing on the project, as New Line wanted him to take a sizable pay cut. On June 3, 2016, The Independent officially reported, after final negotiations took place, that Muschietti had chosen actor Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd to portray the character. On portraying Pennywise, Skarsg\u00e5rd stated, \"It's such an extreme character. Inhumane, It's beyond even a sociopath because he's not even human. He's not even a clown. I'm playing just one of the beings It creates.\" Skarsg\u00e5rd described the character further, saying, \"It truly enjoys the shape of the clown Pennywise, and enjoys the game and the hunt.\" He also commented, \"What's funny to this evil entity might not be funny to everyone else. But he thinks it's funny.\" On Pennywise's design, Skarsg\u00e5rd stated, \"It's important that we do something fresh and original for this one. It's purposely not going toward that weird, greasy look.\" He also commented on being compared to Tim Curry , stating that, \"[Curry]'s performance was truly great, but it's important for me to do something different because of that. I'll never be able to make a Tim Curry performance as good as Tim Curry.\" Skarsg\u00e5rd also elaborated on his age, stating, \"There's a childishness to the character, because he's so closely linked to the kids. The clown is the manifestation of children's imaginations, so there's something child-like about that.\" Producer Dan Lin spoke of Skarsg\u00e5rd's physical attributes: \"His build is really interesting. He's really tall and lanky, and feels a little clown like in his movement. When he came in\u2014we had a lot of different actors read, and when he came in he had a different spin on the character that got us really excited.\" Lin concluded by contrasting the character with that of Heath Ledger 's Joker , \"You've had [Ledger] doing almost a clown joker, you've seen obviously Tim Curry as a clown. We wanted someone who created a Pennywise character that would stand on its own and Bill came in and created this character that frankly freaked us out.\" Muschietti spoke of Skarsg\u00e5rd's Pennywise as one not to lurk in the shadows, to which he remarked, \"Pennywise shows up, he's front and center, and he does his show. He has an act ... So it's weird all the time, and every little thing implies a further threat.\" Muschietti also ",

When the position of a body with respect to its surroundings does not change with time it is said to be \"at rest\". According to the theory of relativity , it is said that an object is \"at rest relative to\" another. For example, a train decelerates approaching a station and eventually comes to rest alongside the platform. The train can be said to be \"at rest with respect to the station\", or, as the correct frame of reference is usually implicit and/or provided by context, simply \"at rest\".",

Barker saw that prisoners being released from the Melbourne Gaol had nowhere to go and no work, so they inevitably re-offended and returned to gaol. Barker leased a small house in Lygon Street, Carlton, to provide accommodation for prisoners discharged from Melbourne's gaols. This led to the formation of the Prison-Gate Brigade, the members of which met discharged prisoners upon their release and offered them a home and the prospect of a job. The Salvos also involved themselves in finding work for the unemployed and in re-uniting families. In Melbourne from 1897 to 1910, The Army's Limelight Department was established as Australia's first film production company. Eighty-f",

The gecko first appeared in 1999, during the Screen Actors Guild strike that prevented the use of live actors. The original commercial features the Gecko, voiced by actor Kelsey Grammer , who climbs onto a microphone on a podium and utters \"This is my final plea: I am a gecko, not to be confused with GEICO, which could save you hundreds on car insurance. So, STOP CALLING ME!\", before licking his eye. Later \"wrong number\" ads used Dave Kelly as the voice of the gecko. In the subsequent commercials with Jake Wood (which portray him as a representative of the company), the gecko speaks with a British Cockney accent , because it would be unexpected, according to Martin Agency's Steve Bassett. In 2010s commercials, the gecko's accent is more working-class, perhaps in an effort to further \"humanize\" him. \"As computer animation got better and as we got to know the character better, we did a few things,\" says Steve Bassett, creative director at The Martin Agency. \"We wanted to make him a little more guy-next-door. And he looks a lot more real than he's looked before.\" Chelsea Clinton , daughter of former president Bill Clinton and then- Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , interviewed the Geico Gecko in April 2013.

    "question": "when did the glazer family takeover manchester united",
    "long_answer": "The club went public in 1990 and was the subject of takeover bids from property trader Michael Knighton and Rupert Murdoch 's BSkyB corporation before Malcolm Glazer 's stake was announced in September 2003. By the end of the year, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004. His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus 's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid. A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing a squeeze out of the remaining 2%. The final purchase price of the club totalled almost \u00a3 800 million.",

What was supposed to be a one-hour meeting turned into a two-and-a-half-hour lunch and we just really got each other.\" She described Jenkins' directing style for the film as \"She's also the kind of director that I really flourish under. She has very strong and particular and specific ideas about what it is she wants to say. She comes from a place of strength always. And so, when you are dealing with someone like that, you feel absolutely free to be vulnerable, to be creative, and I am a big researcher.\" On playing the character, Nielsen said \"It was a complete and utter pleasure and I absolutely loved every second of playing her.\" On her character being Diana's mother and Amazonian queen, Nielsen stated \"I'm queen and I'm preparing my child for a world that entails a lot of responsibility. So it was important to me to bring that into the character.\" She read The Amazons by Adrienne Mayor to familiarize herself with women warriors and said \"I used what I learned in Mayor's book as a rallying cry for how I approached Hippolyta. And then, of course, what is a leader who is elected by her peers every year and has been doing this for a thousand years? That too was interesting to think about\". Nielsen went through a workout regime for the film, saying \"I did six hours a day. You know, two hours of weight training, two hours of swords training, and then two hours of horseback riding\". Nicole Kidman was in negotiations for the role but was forced to drop due to scheduling conflicts with Big Little Lies . Previously, Nielsen had been considered for the role of Superman 's mother, Lara Lor-Van , in Man of Steel . <A hre",

Rather than a chandelier or ceiling fixture, the room is illuminated by light bulbs hidden within the cornice that \"wash\" the ceiling in light. In small ways, hints of Art Moderne can be seen, in the sconces flanking the windows and the representation of the eagle in the ceiling medallion. FDR and Gugler worked closely together, often over breakfast, with Gugler sketching the president's ideas. One notion resulting from these sketches that has become fixed in the layout of the room's furniture, is that of two high back chairs in front of the fireplace. The public sees this most often with the president seated on the left, and a visiting head of state on the right. This allowed FDR to be seated, with his guests at the same level, de-emphasizing his inability to stand. Construction of the modern Oval Office was completed in 1934. <SPAN class=\"mw-headline\"",

Of these three, Love and Poesy are integrated into \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" with an emphasis on how the urn, as a human artistic construct, is capable of relating to the idea of \"Truth\". The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities: an attempt at courtship, the making of music, and a religious rite. The figures are supposed to be beautiful, and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic. Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator, the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images. The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem, which creates ambiguity in the poem's final lines: \"'Beauty is truth, truth beauty,' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\" The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words, to whom they are speaking, and what is meant by the words, which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator.

Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his unmentionable name, and refers to him instead with such expressions as \" You-Know-Who \", \" He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named \" or \" the Dark Lord \".

The Constitution did not use the word \"equality\", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that \"all men are created equal\" remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address : \"Four score and seven years ago [i.e. in 1776] our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\" Lincoln's <A href=\"/wiki/Declarationism\" title=\"Declarationi",

    "long_answer": "tropical wave near Cape Verde on August 30. Favorable conditions allowed Irma to rapidly intensify into a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson wind scale by late on August 31. However, the storm's intensity fluctuated between Categories 2 and 3 for the next several days, due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles . On September 4, Irma resumed intensifying, becoming a Category 5 hurricane by early on the next day, and acquiring annular characteristics . On September 6, Irma peaked with 180 mph (285 km/h) winds and a minimum pressure of 914 hPa (27.0 inHg), making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017, behind only Hurricane Maria , and the strongest worldwide in 2017, in terms of wind speed. Another eyewall replacement cycle caused Irma to weaken back to a Category 4 hurricane, but the storm re-attained Category 5 status before making landfall in Cuba . Although land interaction weakened Irma to a Category 2 storm, the system re-intensified to Category 4 status as it crossed the warm waters of the Straits of Florida , before making landfall on Cudjoe Key with winds at 130 mph, (215 km/h) on September 10. Irma weakened to Category 3 status, prior to another landfall in Florida on Marco Island later that day.

With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created.

    "long_answer": "As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the United States Armed Forces shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an honor guard detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the flag of the United States to the next of kin and the playing of Taps which will be played by a lone bugler , if available, or by audio recording . Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one. However, federal law allows Reserve and National Guard units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary.",

He published a magazine article on the topic with this title, based on his research. He expanded the article into a book, The Stolen Generations (1981). Widespread awareness of the Stolen Generations, and the practices which created it, grew in the late 1980s through the efforts of Aboriginal and white activists , artists, and musicians ( Archie Roach 's \"Took the Children Away\" and Midnight Oil 's \" The Dead Heart \" being examples of the latter). The Mabo v Queensland (No 2) case (commonly known as the Mabo case ) attracted great media and public attention to itself and to all issues related to the government treatment of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations.

    "question": "what percentage of blood is composed of plasma",
    "long_answer": "Blood plasma is a yellowish coloured liquid component of blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension ; this makes plasma the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It makes up about 55% of the body's total blood volume. It is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid (all body fluid outside cells). It is mostly water (up to 95% by volume), and contains dissolved proteins (6\u20138%) (i.e.\u2014 serum albumins , globulins , and fibrinogen ), glucose , clotting factors , electrolytes (Na , Ca , Mg , HCO 3 , Cl , etc.), hormones , carbon dioxide (plasma being the main medium for excretory product transportation) and oxygen . Plasma also serves as the protein reserve of the human body. It plays a vital role in an intravascular osmotic effect that keeps electrolytes in balanced form and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders. Bloo",

    "question": "the first public playhouse ( the theatre ) is built in london",
    "long_answer": "The Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague , not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city. This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the liberties of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later the Clink , and at Newington Butts near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey. The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one John Brayne , (the owner of the Red Lion) on property that had originally been the grounds of the dissolved Halliwell Priory (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575). The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the theatre . This area in the \"suburbs of sin\" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the Curtain Theatre was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district. \"When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage\" Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started. <",

At the Citadel , Samwell steals books that reveal a large reservoir of dragonglass in Dragonstone , and sends word to Jon. He later finds Jorah in a cell. In the Riverlands , Arya meets a group of friendly Lannister soldiers, who take her intention to kill Cersei as a joke. Thoros shows Sandor a vision in the fire. The revelation leads him to believe in the Lord of Light. In King's Landing , Jaime tells Cersei of the crucial need for allies. She welcomes Euron , who proposes marriage to her in exchange for his Iron Fleet and a chance to kill Theon and Yara . Cersei declines citing trust as a concern, so Euron promises to return with a \"gift\" to prove his loyalty.

They transformed Philibert de l'Orme's facades and central pavilion, replacing its grand central staircase with a colonnaded vestibule on the ground floor and the Salle des Cents Suisses (Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards) on the floor above and adding a rectangular dome. A new grand staircase was installed in the entrance of the north wing of the palace, and lavishly decorated royal apartments were constructed in the south wing. The king's rooms were on the ground floor, facing toward the Louvre, and the queen's on the floor above, overlooking the garden. At the same time, Louis' gardener, Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre , redesigned the Tuileries gardens. The Court moved into the Tuileries Palace in November 1667, but left in 1672, and soon thereafter went to the Palace of Versailles . The Tuileries Palace was virtually abandoned and used only as a theatre, but its gardens became a fashionable resort of Parisians. <SPAN class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Louis_X",

    "long_answer": "peninsula in France that largely corresponds to the modern French province is Lesser or Little Britain . That region was settled by many British immigrants during the period of Anglo-Saxon migration into Britain, and named \"Little Britain\" by them. The French term \"Bretagne\" now refers to the French \"Little Britain\", not to the British \"Great Britain\", which in French is called Grande-Bretagne . In classical times, the Graeco-Roman geographer Ptolemy in his Almagest also called the larger island megale Brettania (great Britain). At that time, it was in contrast to the smaller island of Ireland , which he called mikra Brettania (little Britain). In his later work Geography , Ptolemy refers to Great Britain as Albion and to Ireland as Iwernia . These \"new\" names were likely to have been the native names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast , were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.

    "long_answer": "Bubble and squeak is a traditional English dish made with the shallow-fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner . The main ingredients are potato and cabbage , but carrots , peas , Brussels sprouts , or any other leftover vegetables can be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes until the mixture is well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process. It is often served with cold meat from the Sunday roast , and pickles or brown sauce , or as an accompaniment to a full English breakfast .",

    "question": "what is the highest heart beat per minute",
    "long_answer": "Many texts cite the normal resting adult human heart rate as ranging from 60\u2013100 bpm. Tachycardia is a fast heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest. Bradycardia is a slow heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest.

The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas , a fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra , the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas (himself also based on Saint Nicholas).

    "question": "what family is rosaline from in romeo and juliet",
    "long_answer": "Romeo meets Juliet , he loves Rosaline, Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He describes her as wonderfully beautiful: \"The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.\" Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste ; Romeo says: \"She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now.\" This is the source of his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: \"That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad.\" Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like \"a crow\" alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: \"Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.\" Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play. <SPAN c",

The theory was popularized in the 1840s by Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle , but in 1860 Herbert Spencer formulated a counter-argument that has remained influential throughout the 20th century to the present: Spencer said that such great men are the products of their societies, and that their actions would be impossible without the social conditions built before their lifetimes.",

Naturalisation is also possible for foreign nationals after six to eight years of legal residence in Germany. However, non-EU and non-Swiss citizens must usually renounce their old citizenship before being naturalised in Germany. Citizens of other EU countries and of Switzerland usually can keep their old citizenship. Some EU countries do not allow dual citizenship even with other EU countries. German citizens wanting to acquire a non-EU or non-Swiss citizenship and to maintain their German citizenship must apply for a permission ( Beibehaltungsgenehmigung ) before acquiring the other citizenship, or they will automatically lose their German citizenship when they acquire the foreign citizenship.

    "question": "what is the significance of the nodes of ranvier",
    "long_answer": "Nodes of Ranvier , also known as myelin-sheath gaps , occur along a myelinated axon where the axolemma is exposed to the extracellular space. Nodes of Ranvier are uninsulated and highly enriched in ion channels , allowing them to participate in the exchange of ions required to regenerate the action potential . Nerve conduction in myelinated axons is referred to as saltatory conduction (from the Latin saltare \"to hop or to leap\") due to the manner in which the action potential seems to \"jump\" from one node to the next along the axon. This results in faster conduction of the action potential. <",

In this film, Jason is portrayed in the memories of his mother, Mrs. Voorhees ( Betsy Palmer ), and as a hallucination of the film's protagonist, Alice ( Adrienne King ). Though the character makes no contemporary appearance onscreen, he propels the film's plot\u2014Mrs. Voorhees, the cook at Camp Crystal Lake, seeks revenge for his death, which she blames on the camp counselors. Jason's second appearance was in the sequel, Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981). Revealed to be alive, an adult Jason exacts revenge on Alice for decapitating his mother in the original film. Jason (Steven Dash and Warrington Gillette ), returns to Crystal Lake, living there as a hermit and guarding it from all intruders. Five years later a group of teenagers arrive to set up a new camp, only to be murdered one by one by Jason, who wears a pillow case over his head to hide his face. Ginny ( Amy Steel ), the lone survivor , finds a cabin in the woods with a shrine built around the severed head of Mrs. Voorhees, and surrounded by mutilated corpses. Ginny fights back and slams a machete through Jason's shoulder. Jason is left for dead as Ginny is taken away in an ambulance. In Friday the 13th Part III (1982), Jason ( Richard Brooker ) escapes to a nearby lake resort, Higgins Haven, to rest from his wounds. At the same time, Chris Higgins ( Dana Kimmell ) returns to the property with some friends. An unmasked and reclusive Jason kills anyone who wanders into the barn where he is hiding. Taking a hockey mask from a victim to hide his face, he leaves the barn to kill the rest of the group. Chris fends off Jason by slamming an axe into his head, but the night's events drive her into hysteria as the police take her away. <I",

He founded New France by planting a cross on the shore of the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula . The French subsequently tried to establish several colonies throughout North America that failed, due to weather, disease, or conflict with other European powers. Cartier attempted to create the first permanent European settlement in North America at Cap-Rouge (Quebec City) in 1541 with 400 settlers but the settlement was abandoned the next year after bad weather and attacks from Native Americans in the area. A small group of French troops were left on Parris Island, South Carolina in 1562 to build Charlesfort , but left after a year when they were not resupplied by France. Fort Caroline established in present-day Jacksonville, Florida , in 1564, lasted only a year before being destroyed by the Spanish from St. Augustine . An attempt to settle convicts on Sable Island off Nova Scotia in 1598 failed after a short time. In 1599, a sixteen-person trading post was established in Tadoussac (in present-day Quebec ), of which only five men survived the first winter. In 1604 Pierre Du Gua de Monts and Samuel de Champlain founded a short-lived French colony, the first in Acadia , on Saint Croix Island , presently part of the state of Maine , which was much plagued by illness, perhaps scurvy.

There are still many practitioners of traditional son montuno , such as Eliades Ochoa , who have recorded and toured widely as a result of interest in the son montuno after the Buena Vista Social Club success. Europe-based Cuban female singer-songwriter Addys Mercedes merged her roots of Son and Filin with elements of urban, rock and pop-music, reaching mainstream airplay charts in Germany.

He explained that in 1936, real estate developer Stanley Williamson conceived the idea of creating a commercial center outside of the over-congested downtown retail district, in Tucson. His model for this business center was the Miracle Mile in Los Angeles, Calif. The one in L.A., was the idea of real estate agent A.W. Ross, who saw that the retail district in that city was overcrowded and, also saw that cars were becoming more common. He came up with the idea of buying farming land, along Wilshire Blvd., several miles out from downtown, with the belief that as more people bought automobiles they would be willing to drive farther, in order to avoid the lack of parking and congestion in the downtown area. While initially no one thought his idea would work, in time store after store came to his business center. The Miracle Mile eventually became one of Los Angeles' premier shopping districts. Ross originally called his business area, the Wilshire Boulevard Center, it was changed to the Miracle Mile in 1928. <SPAN class=\"mw-hea",

She forgives Declan and they go for coffee, leaving Shawn unable to say anything. \"One, Maybe Two, Ways Out\" (5.09) - Juliet is now in a serious relationship with Declan, of which Shawn is very jealous. Declan is even planning a vacation for Juliet and himself. After Shawn and Gus cause Nadia's capture, Juliet overhears Shawn telling Gus that he cannot be happy without her, though he knows he should be glad that she is happily in a relationship. Juliet is visibly affected by his words. After Nadia is freed and Fong is taken into custody, Shawn and Gus again arrive at Declan's residence. Declan tells them to make their visit quick, as he is bidding 30 million euros on an item over the phone. Gus, intrigued by this, follows Declan upstairs. Shawn is left alone in the foyer, at which point Juliet enters the room, surprised to see him. She questions Shawn about how he solved such an intricate case and why there might be three creme brul\u00e9 dishes at Declan's computer, but he does not rat out Declan for helping. Shawn wishes her a great four days off, but she corrects that it is two weeks, visibly upsetting him. He makes Juliet promise to enjoy her vacation, and tells her to take many mental photographs. As Shawn starts going off on a tangent, Juliet abruptly kisses him. She then pulls back, and both Shawn and she are left speechless from the kiss. Declan and Gus return, and Shawn, too stunned to make any witty remarks, simply wishes them a good vacation. Declan goes to pack as Shaw",

Most scholars today agree that the dromedary was exploited as a pack animal sometime in the early Iron Age (not before the 12th century [BC])\" and concludes that \"Current data from copper smelting sites of the Aravah Valley enable us to pinpoint the introduction of domestic camels to the southern Levant more precisely based on stratigraphic contexts associated with an extensive suite of radiocarbon dates . The data indicate that this event occurred not earlier than the last third of the 10th century [BC] and most probably during this time. The coincidence of this event with a major reorganization of the copper industry of the region\u2014attributed to the results of the campaign of Pharaoh Shoshenq I \u2014raises the possibility that the two were connected, and that camels were introduced as part of the efforts to improve efficiency by facilitating trade.\" Textiles <SPAN clas",

    "question": "why there are 29 days in february in a leap year",
    "long_answer": "Sun takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 days (8,760 hours). A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth 's position in the Solar System ; otherwise, seasons would occur earlier than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11 , and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the \"century rule\" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox .",

The culmination of the Yorktown campaign , the siege proved to be the last major land battle of the American Revolutionary War in the North American theater, as the surrender by Cornwallis, and the capture of both him and his army, prompted the British government to negotiate an end to the conflict. The battle boosted faltering American morale and revived French enthusiasm for the war, as well as undermining popular support for the conflict in Great Britain.

    "question": "why did european countries want empires in the 19th century",
    "long_answer": "The colonial empires began with a race of exploration between the then most advanced maritime powers, Portugal and Spain , during the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade , driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the European Renaissance . Agreements were also made to divide the world up between them in 1479 , 1493 , and 1494 . European imperialism was born out of competition between European Christians and Ottoman Muslims, the latter of which rose up quickly in the 14th century and forced the Spanish and Portuguese to seek new trade routes to India, and to a lesser extent, China. <",

    "long_answer": "Today, most cultures retain a distinction between lying in general (which is discouraged under most, but not all, circumstances) versus perjury (which is always unlawful under criminal law and liable to punishment). Similarly, historically in Jewish tradition, a distinction was made between lying in general and bearing false witness (perjury) specifically. On the one hand, bearing false witness (perjury) was always prohibited according to the decalogue 's commandement against bearing false witness, yet on the other hand, lying in general was acknowledged to be, in certain circumstances \"permissible or even commendable\" when it was a white lie , and it was done while not under oath, and it was not \"harmful to someone else\". <",

It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus, and thus uniquely identifies an element. Hence, the difference between the mass number and the atomic number gives the number of neutrons ( N ) in a given nucleus: N = A \u2212 Z {\\displaystyle N=A-Z} . T",

The sculpture in the older temple's sanctum was re-consecrated and incorporated into the newer larger temple. This chronology of temple site's evolution is supported by many copper plate inscriptions of the era in which the Konark temple is referred to as the \"great cottage\".

    "long_answer": "Hemostasis or haemostasis is a process which causes bleeding to stop, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage ). It is the first stage of wound healing . This involves coagulation , blood changing from a liquid to a gel. Intact blood vessels are central to moderating blood's tendency to form clots . The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin-like molecule and thrombomodulin and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin . When endothelial injury occurs, the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury. Hemostasis has three major steps: 1) vasoconstriction, 2) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3) blood coagulation, or formation of a fibrin clot. These processes seal the hole until tissues are repaired.",

The term also applies to the licence granted to the establishment itself. Off-licences typically are specialist shops, convenience shops, parts of supermarkets, or attached to bars and pubs. Prices are usually substantially lower than in bars or pubs. Off-licence is also used in New Zealand for beverage outlets inside sporting venues, whereby alcoholic beverages are brought \"outside\" the point-of-sale, even if it was inside a food outlet, because it can be consumed at the stands, but is still consumed within the vicinity of the venue itself, and cannot be taken out of the venue.",

February 19, 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Grand Zen\u014d and Future Grand Zen\u014d is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Grand Minister announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender ( \u30e9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0 , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match.

February 26, 2017 TBA As their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Grand Minister announces to those in attendance that all universes that l",

Uncontrolled, objects accelerate through the atmosphere at extreme velocities under the influence of Earth's gravity . Most controlled objects enter at hypersonic speeds due to their suborbital (e.g., intercontinental ballistic missile reentry vehicles), orbital (e.g., the Space Shuttle ), or unbounded (e.g., meteors ) trajectories. Various advanced technologies have been developed to enable atmospheric reentry and flight at extreme velocities. An alternative low velocity method of controlled atmospheric entry is buoyancy which is suitable for planetary entry where thick atmospheres, strong gravity or both factors complicate high-velocity hyperbolic entry, such as the atmospheres of Venus , Titan and the gas giants . <",

The first proof sets through 1964 were minted at the Philadelphia Mint . There were two official releases in 1942: one regular five coin set and a set including a silver wartime nickel . United States currency was debased beginning in 1965, but the sets continued under the name United States Mint Proof Set.Production was moved to the San Francisco branch in 1968, and all subsequent issues bear coins with an \"S\" mint mark. In 1973, the Eisenhower dollar was added to the collection. Sets from 1975 will have a dual-date 1776-1976 quarter, half-dollar, and dollar as none of those coins were ever produced with a 1975 date. The Susan B. Anthony dollar replaced the Eisenhower in 1979. The 1981 mint sets were the only method of obtaining a Susan B. from that year, though many have slipped into circulation. With the cease in minting of dollar coins, the regular issue Proof Set for 1982 included a brass token. From 1983 until 1998, the annual United States Proof set resumed to only issuing the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, and half-dollar. <",

A convention in 1787 wrote a new Constitution that was adopted in 1789. In 1791, a Bill of Rights was added to guarantee inalienable rights . With Washington as the first president and Alexander Hamilton his chief adviser, a strong central government was created.

This medium has been chemically enriched by trace amounts of heavier elements that were ejected from stars as they passed beyond the end of their main sequence lifetime. Higher density regions of the interstellar medium form clouds, or diffuse nebulae , where star formation takes place.

After working on his revolutionary difference engine , designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine , was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards , a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom . For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit , control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops , and integrated memory , making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete .

    "long_answer": "In the biological sciences , nitrogenous bases are increasingly termed nucleobases because of their role in nucleic acids - their flat shape is particularly important when considering their roles as the building blocks of DNA and RNA . A set of five nitrogenous bases is used in the construction of nucleotides , which in turn build up the nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. These nitrogenous bases are adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). The nitrogenous bases form hydrogen bonds between opposing DNA strands to form the rungs of the \"twisted ladder\" or double helix of DNA or a biological catalyst that is found in the nucleotides . Adenine is always paired with thymine, and guanine is always paired with cytosine. These are known as base pairs . Uracil is only present in RNA, replacing thymine. Pyrimidines include thymine, cytosine, and uracil. They have a single ring structure. Purines include adenine and guanine. They have a double ring structure.",

Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the nineteenth century. The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the nineteenth century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions.

    "question": "where should an object be placed in front of a convex lens which signifies it as a magnifying glass",
    "long_answer": "The magnification of a magnifying glass depends upon where it is placed between the user's eye and the object being viewed, and the total distance between them. The magnifying power is equivalent to angular magnification (this should not be confused with optical power , which is a different quantity). The magnifying power is the ratio of the sizes of the images formed on the user's retina with and without the lens. For the \"without\" case, it is typically assumed that the user would bring the object as close to one eye as possible without it becoming blurry. This point, known as the near point , varies with age . In a young child, it can be as close as 5 cm, while, in an elderly person it may be as far as one or two metres. Magnifiers are typically characterized using a \"standard\" value of 0.25 m.",

    "question": "how many different species of mosquitoes are there",
    "long_answer": "Anopheles gambiae is currently undergoing speciation into the M(opti) and S(avanah) molecular forms. Consequently, some pesticides that work on the M form no longer work on the S form. Over 3,500 species of the Culicidae have already been described. They are generally divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera. These figures are subject to continual change, as more species are discovered, and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family. The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae, with their genera as shown in the subsection below. The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases. Roughly speaking, arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species, not necessarily in the genus Culex . Some transmit various species of avian malaria , but it is not clear that they ever transmit any form of human malaria. Some species do however transmit various forms of filariasis , much as many Simuliidae do. Anoph",

    "question": "when did the heart become associated with love",
    "long_answer": "Roman de la poire (National Library FR MS. 2086, plate 12). In the miniature a kneeling lover (or more precisely, an allegory of the lover's \"sweet gaze\" or douz regart ) offers his heart to a damsel. The heart here resembles a pine cone (held \"upside down\", the point facing upward), in accord with medieval anatomical descriptions. However, in this miniature what suggests a heart shape is only the result of a lover's finger superimposed on an object; the full shape outline of the object is partly hidden, and therefore unknown. Moreover, the French title of the manuscript that features the miniature translates into \"Novel Of The Pear\" in English. Thus the heart shaped object would be a pear; the conclusion that a pear represents a heart is dubious. Opinions therefore differ over this being the first depiction of a heart as symbol of romantic love. Giotto in his 1305 painting in the Scrovegni Chapel ( Padua ) shows an allegory of charity (caritas) handing her heart to Jesus Christ . This heart is also depicted in the pine cone shape based on anatomical descriptions of the day (still held \"upside down\"). Giotto's painting exerted considerable influence on later painters, and the motive of Caritas offering a heart is shown by Taddeo Gaddi in Santa Croce, by Andrea Pisano on the bronze door of the south porch of the Baptisterium in Florence (c. 1337), by Ambrogio Lorenzetti in the Palazzo Publico in Siena (c. 1340) and by Andrea da Firenze in Santa Maria Novella in Florence (c. 1365). The convention of showing the heart point upward switches in the late 14th century and becomes rare in the first half of the 15th century. The",

    "long_answer": "was held on Thursday, 6 May 2010, with 45,597,461 registered voters entitled to vote to elect members to the House of Commons . The election took place in 650 constituencies across the United Kingdom under the first-past-the-post system. None of the parties achieved the 326 seats needed for an overall majority. The Conservative Party , led by David Cameron , won the largest number of votes and seats, but still fell 20 seats short. This resulted in a hung parliament where no party was able to command a majority in the House of Commons. This was only the second general election since the Second World War to return a hung parliament, the first being the February 1974 election . Unlike in 1974, the potential for a hung parliament had this time been widely considered and predicted, and both the country and politicians were better prepared for the constitutional process that would follow such a result. The coalition government that was subsequently formed was the first coalition in British history to eventuate directly from an election outcome. The hung parliament came about in spite of the Conservatives managing both a higher vote total and higher share of the vote than the previous Labour government had done in 2005 , when it secured a comfortable majority. <A href=\"/wiki/Coalition_government",

    "question": "where did the term rat rod come from",
    "long_answer": "The origin of the term \"rat rod\" is the subject of dispute, but were coined by one specific person in the Shifters So. Cal. car club. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Anthony Casteneda thought of the word when they were interviewed in a Rod & Custom magazine article. Anthony stated that to him and his car club, their traditional hot rods were lacking certain elements like paint and/or upholstery, and were similar to rat bikes of their time period, thus the name Rat Rods. The Shifters So.Cal. started a trend of younger guys that were in to Rockabilly music,dressed in a 1950s Greaser style, that were building period correct pre war hot rods. This trend started in southern California. Soon after the Rod & Custom Magazine article featured the Shifters, magazines such as Burn Out, Continental Restyling,Hot Rod,Cal,and Hop Up featured the club and this new phenomena that was hitting not only southern California, but cities all over the nation. Opinions regarding the term's origins were based in one of the following perspectives: Years later, in 1998,one of many articles was written in Hot Rod Magazine , this was done by automotive journalist Gray Baskerville, about cars that, at that time, continued to be covered by primer; or, the first rat rod was owned by artist, Robert Williams , who had a '32 Ford Roadster that was painted in primer. However, Hot Rod magazine has verified the latter view. Gray's use of the term was in relation to \"Rat Bikes,\" motorcycles that were assembled from spare parts, to be enjoyed and ridden, and not necessarily for the display of the builder's skills. It is believed that the term is likely to have originally been used in a derogatory or pejorative sense, as this remains the case among sections of the hot rod community; however, the term has also been adopted in a positive light by other parts of the sub-culture. <",

Originally recorded over a three-day period at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Sheffield, Alabama , from 2 to 4 December 1969, the song was not released until over a year later due to legal wranglings with the band's former label, though at the request of guitarist Mick Taylor , they debuted the number live during the infamous concert at Altamont on 6 December. The song was written by Jagger with Marsha Hunt in mind; Hunt was Jagger's secret girlfriend and mother of his first child Karis. It is also claimed it was written with Claudia Lennear in mind. Lennear made this claim on BBC's Radio 4 (25 February 2014, Today ), saying that it was written with her in mind because at the time when it was written, Mick Jagger used to hang around with her.

    "question": "what is the role of antibodies in the immune response",
    "long_answer": "An antibody ( Ab ), also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ), is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen , via the Fab's variable region . Each tip of the \"Y\" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) that is specific for one particular epitope (similarly analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize its target directly (for example, by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival). Depending on the antigen, the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may activate macrophages to destroy the foreign substance. The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region (located at the base of the \"Y\"), which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions. The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system .",

This shift has changed the rotational axis of the moon allowing sunlight to reach areas of the moon previously shadowed. The axis spin is 88.5 degrees from the plane of the elliptic. The south pole contains areas of permanent darkness, where the sunlight never reaches. On the contrary, the pole also contains areas with permanent exposure to sunlight. The south pole contains many craters and basins such as the South Pole-Aitken basin; which appears to be one of the most fundamental features of the moon. The south pole contains mountains such as Epsilon Peak which is taller than any mountain found on earth. The south pole is thermally benign , ranging at an average of 250\u2013270 kelvins . <SP",

Continuing northward, the hurricane struck Mais\u00ed in Cuba early on October 5 as a slightly weaker storm. Cuba's and Haiti's mountainous terrain weakened Matthew to Category 3 status, as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the Bahamas . Restrengthening occurred as Matthew's circulation became better organized, with the storm becoming a Category 4 hurricane again while passing Freeport . However, Matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place. The storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of Florida and Georgia, with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in Florida while the system was a Category 3 hurricane (with the strongest winds remaining just offshore). Matthew weakened to a Category 2 hurricane late on October 7 and then to a Category 1 hurricane by 12:00 UTC on October 8. <DIV class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"wi",

The concept was first introduced for artillery and was a common feature on many anti-tank guns , especially those mounted on tanks , in order to reduce the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback. They have been used in various forms for rifles and pistols to help control recoil and the rising of the barrel that normally occurs after firing. They are used on pistols for practical pistol competitions, and are usually called compensators in this context.",

The World Social Forum can be considered a visible manifestation of global civil society , bringing together non governmental organizations , advocacy campaigns, and formal and informal social movements seeking international solidarity . The World Social Forum prefers to define itself as \"an opened space \u2013 plural, diverse, non-governmental and non-partisan \u2013 that stimulates the decentralized debate, reflection, proposals building, experiences exchange and alliances among movements and organizations engaged in concrete actions towards a more solidarity, democratic and fair world....a permanent space and process to build alternatives to neoliberalism .\" It is held by members of the alter-globalization movement (also referred to as the global justice movement ) who come together to coordinate global campaigns, share and refine organizing strategies, and inform each other about movements from around the world and their particular issues. The World Social Forum is explicit about not being a representative of all of those who attend and thus does not publish any formal statements on behalf of participants. It tends to meet in January at the same time as its \"great capitalist rival\", the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos , Switzerland . This date is consciously picked to promote alternative answers to world economic problems in opposition to the World Economic Forum. <DI",

Donald O'Connor as Cosmo Brown, Don's lifelong pal, and vaudeville partner, who becomes the head of Monumental Pictures' music department. Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont.

Because the United States federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a very small percentage of cases, such as copyright disputes, patent disputes, and United States bankruptcy court disputes, state courts have the authority to hear the vast majority of cases. <H2",

The agreement was approved by Congress in 1922, the same year it was signed. Colorado River Compact was signed by the delegates from the seven Colorado River Basin states: Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico were designated Upper Basin states and California, Arizona and Nevada as the Lower Basin states. This compact determined that the water would be shared equally among the upper and lower basin states. Prior to the compact, the name of the river was standardized along its length. Previously the portion of the river upstream from its confluence with the Green River had been known locally as the \"Grand River\". The change was opposed by many local residents in Utah and Colorado, and the new name was enforced locally by acts of the state legislatures in both states in the early 1920s. One of the major concerns both today and back in the 1920s was the expanding population, and this increased the demand for water, particularly in California.

    "question": "dance created for the entertainment of the aristocracy is called",
    "long_answer": "Ballet is a formalized form of dance with its origins in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th and 16th centuries. Ballet spread from Italy to France with the help of Catherine de' Medici , where ballet developed even further under her aristocratic influence. An early example of Catherine's development of ballet is through 'Le Paradis d' Amour', a piece of work presented at her daughter's wedding, Marguerite de Valois to Henry of Navarre . Aristocratic money was responsible for the initial stages of development in 'court ballet', as it was royal money that dictated the ideas, literature and music used in ballets that were created to primarily entertain the aristocrats of the time. The first formal 'court ballet' ever recognized was staged in 1573, 'Ballet des Polonais'. In true form of royal entertainment, 'Ballet des Polonais' was commissioned by Catherine de' Medici to honor the Polish ambassadors who were visiting Paris upon the accession of Henry of Anjou to the throne of Poland. In 1581, Catherine de' Medici commissioned another court ballet, Ballet Comique de la Reine , however it was her compatriot, Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx , who organized the ballet. Catherine de' Medici and Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx were responsible for presenting the first court ballet ever to apply the principles of Baif's Academie, by integrating poetry, dance, music and set design to convey a unified dramatic storyline. Moreover, the early organization and development of 'court ballet' was funded by, influenced by and produced by the aristocrats of the time, fulfilling both their personal entertainment and political propaganda needs.",

It originally consisted of foot races only, as did the competition for males. Some texts, including Pausanias's Description of Greece , c. AD 175 , state that Hippodameia gathered a group known as the \"Sixteen Women\" and made them administrators of the Heraea Games, out of gratitude for her marriage to Pelops . Other texts related to the Elis and Pisa conflict indicate that the \" Sixteen Women \" were peacemakers from Pisa and Elis and, because of their political competence, became administrators of the Heraea. Being the consort of Hera in Classical Greek mythology , Zeus was the father of the deities in the pantheon of that era. The Sanctuary of Zeus in Olympia housed a 13-metre-high (43 ft) statue in ivory and gold of Zeus that had been sculpted by Phidias circa 445 BC. This statue was one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World . By the time of the Classical Greek culture, in the fifth and fourth centuries BC, the games were restricted to male participants.

The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688\u20131720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament. Although the Sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.

One of the most prominent attractions to the disclosure protection laws is the distinction between tax evasion (non-reporting of income) and tax fraud (active deception). Akin to the distinction between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion in the U.S., the non-reporting of income is only a civil offense in Switzerland while tax fraud is a financial crime. When foreign clients deposit holdings into a Swiss bank account, the bank is legally prohibited from disclosing balances or client information to tax authorities. This prohibition can only be waved if the client has produced a written statement of consent or a financial crime has been directly linked to the bank account. More often than not, clients don't consent to foreign tax authorities which leaves only the latter circumstance available. Many client services available in Switzerland (e.g. numbered bank accounts ) are used to shield client data from tax authorities. Breaches of banking secrecy laws in Switzerl",

All of England's games were played at Wembley, which was (and still is) the England national team's home stadium.

Charlton then hit both goals in a 2-1 semi-final win over Portugal (a game that was originally supposed to be played at Liverpool's Goodison Park ) and England had reached the final, where they would meet West Germany.

She then drives to the Dead Zone, where the rover breaks down in a storm. She follows a bird, at one stage considering suicide, and discovers the Eden Valley. She finds a room of dead people, then a young nightblood girl who runs from her. Clarke follows her and tries to get acquainted with her, which doesn't work until Clarke draws a sketch of her. The time jumps back to six years after Praimfaya, where Clarke and the Nightblood, Madi, are living together.

The stretch also serves as a short break for the players. Most ballparks in professional baseball mark this point of the game by playing the crowd sing-along song \" Take Me Out to the Ball Game \". Since the September 11 attacks , many American ballparks complement or replace the song with the playing of \" God Bless America .\" If a game goes into a fifth extra inning, a similar \"fourteenth-inning stretch\" is celebrated (as well as a possible \"twenty-first inning stretch\" or \"twenty-eighth inning stretch\").

    "question": "what was the ruling in brown v. board of education",
    "long_answer": "Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. The decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896, which allowed state-sponsored segregation, insofar as it applied to public education. Handed down on May 17, 1954, the Warren Court 's unanimous (9\u20130) decision stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\" As a result, de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution . This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the Civil Rights Movement , and a model for many future impact litigation cases. However, the decision's fourteen pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial segregation in schools, and the Court's second decision in Brown II ( 349 U.S. 294 (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate \"with all deliberate speed\". <DIV id=\"",

    "question": "why do the welsh have a dragon on their flag",
    "long_answer": "The flag was granted official status in 1959, but the red dragon itself has been associated with Wales for centuries, though the origin of the adoption of the dragon symbol is now lost in history and myth . A possible theory is that the Romans brought the emblem to what is now Wales during their occupation of Britain in the form of the Draco standards borne by the Roman cavalry, itself inspired by the symbols of the Dacians or Parthians . The Olm (Proteus anguinus) of Slovenia bear a similarity in miniature to the Draco standard and they are referred to as baby cave dragons by the locals. The green and white stripes of the flag were additions by the House of Tudor , the Welsh dynasty that held the English throne from 1485 to 1603. Green and white are also the colours of the leek , another national emblem of Wales. <",

Daya shoots CO Thomas Humphrey in the thigh after he begins begging for his life in Spanish, a language she does not speak. His life is eventually saved by Sophia, who has paramedic training from her days as a firefighter. Piper and Alex try to take Linda hostage, but then feel bad for her and help her disguise herself as an inmate. Taystee, Black Cindy, Janae and Alison force Caputo to read a statement about Poussey's death, which Taystee records on an iPad. Josh, a PR representative from MCC who was visiting Caputo, helps her upload it to Twitter, since he thinks the story of a renegade CO reflects better on the company than out-of-control inmates. Daya attempts to contact Aleida, but an unseen person knocks her unconscious and steals the gun from her. 54 2 \"Fuck, Marry, Frieda\" Constantine Makris Jordan Harrison Frieda June 9, 2017 ( 2017-06-09 ) The prison stays under control of the inmates, who are holding several corrections officers hostage.

In pre-modern times, ownership of a silver spoon was an indication of social class, denoting membership in the land-owning classes. In the Middle Ages, when farmers and craftsmen worked long hours and frequently got dirt under their fingernails, it was important to not be mistaken for a serf or escaped slave . Under these circumstances, a silver spoon served the functional equivalent of passport, driving licence, and credit card. Since most members of the land-owning classes were smallhold farmers and craftsmen, the silver spoon was primarily a lower-middle-class cultural marker. <",

    "question": "in what region of the united states were totem poles common forms of native american art",
    "long_answer": "Totem poles are monumental carvings, a type of Northwest Coast art , consisting of poles, posts or pillars, carved with symbols or figures. They are usually made from large trees, mostly western red cedar , by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America ( Washington , Oregon , and Canada's western province, British Columbia ). The word totem derives from the Algonquian (most likely Ojibwe ) word o doodem [ o\u02c8tu\u02d0t\u025bm ], \"(his) kinship group\". The carvings may symbolize or commemorate cultural beliefs that recount familiar legends, clan lineages, or notable events. The poles may also serve as functional architectural features, welcome signs for village visitors, mortuary vessels for the remains of deceased ancestors, or as a means to publicly ridicule someone. They may embody a historical narrative of significance to the people carving and installing the pole. Given the complexity and symbolic meanings of totem pole carvings, their placement and importance lies in the observer's knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures and the culture in which they are embedded. <P",

After many years, she collects her courage and confesses to him, only to be bluntly turned down. Irie even goes so far as to say he hates stupid girls (meaning her) and doesn't even read her confession letter. When an earthquake strikes Tokyo, her house is the only one damaged. A friend of Kotoko's father jumps at the opportunity to lend a hand, and in a surprising turn of events they end up living at Irie's house. 02 \"Living Together is Dangerous\" \"Abunai Doukyo Seikatsu\" (\u30a2\u30d6\u306a\u3044\u540c\u5c45\u751f\u6d3b) 9 April 2008 While walking to school together, Irie tells Kotoko that he doesn't care for her, and when Kotoko is pushed off the train at the wrong station Irie does not help her, saying he hates absent-minded girls even more than stupid ones. Using an embarrassing childhood picture, Kotoko blackmails Irie into tutoring her on the next exam, saying she'll hand over the picture if she makes it into the top 50 scores among the students. As they study, the two of them get to know each other better, and Irie's mother hands Kotoko a good luck charm for the test. Kotoko misses the train again, but this time Irie helps her. After the test, Kotoko makes it to the 50th spot, while Irie ranks number one. Kotoko opens the charm to reveal a picture of the two of them sleeping peacefully while studying. Her friends find out and end up teasing Irie, who angrily turns on Kotoko. 03 \"Baton Touch of Love\" \"Koi no batontacchi\" (\u604b\u306e\u30d0\u30c8\u30f3\u30bf\u30c3\u30c1) 16 April 2008 Kotoko falls asleep with a confession letter in her hand. When Irie walks in to tell her it's her turn in the shower, he impulsively decides to read the letter. Later at the school sports festival, Kotoko and Irie end up competing against each other in the relay race. Just as Irie sprints across the finish line, Kotoko gets pushed and falls in front of him and she gets run over. Kin steams as Irie carries her to the nurse. Irie embarrassingly recites the letter she wrote to him; before he gets to the last part where she had written that she loves him, she jumps up and slaps him. Then Kin jumps in the room and proceeds to boast of his passion for Kotoko. Irie replies that people's feelings can change, the person you hate might become the person you love. 04 \"Throbbing Summer Vacation\" \"Dokki doki na natsuyasumi\" (\u30c9\u30c3\u30ad\u30c9\u30ad\u306a\u590f\u4f11\u307f) 23 April 2008 Kotoko, Irie and friends visit Waterland.

These shotgun shells using paper hulls were nearly always roll crimped, although fold crimping also eventually became popular. The primers on these paper hull shotgun shells also changed from the pistol primers used on the early brass shotgun shells to a primer containing both the priming charge and an anvil, unlike rifle and pistol ammunition, making the shotgun shell primer taller. Card wads, made of felt and cork, as well as paperboard, were all used at various times, gradually giving way to plastic over powder wads, with card wads, and, eventually, to all plastic wads. Starting in the 1960s, plastic cases started to replace paper hulls for shotgun shells; by the 1980s, plastic cases had become almost universal. <",

The war is notorious for the loss of 4,500 British and Indian soldiers, plus 12,000 of their camp followers , to Afghan tribal fighters, but the British defeated the Afghans in the concluding engagement. Initially, the British successfully intervened in a succession dispute between emir Dost Mohammad ( Barakzai ) and former emir Shah Shujah ( Durrani ), whom they installed upon conquering Kabul in August 1839. However, in 1841 the Army of the Indus, numbering between 24,000 and 28,000 including families of soldiers, military and political pundits, suffered a series of defeats at the hands of rebel Afghan tribesmen. The main British Indian and Sikh force occupying Kabul, having endured harsh winters as well, was almost completely annihilated while retreating in January 1842.

    "long_answer": "[21] Many European statesmen and industrialists wanted to accelerate the Scramble for Africa , securing colonies before they strictly needed them. As a champion of Realpolitik , Bismarck disliked colonies and thought they were a waste of time, but his hand was forced by pressure from both the elites and the general population which considered the colonization a necessity for German prestige. German colonies in Togoland , Samoa , South-West Africa and New Guinea had corporate commercial roots, while the equivalent German-dominated areas in East Africa and China owed more to political motives. The British also took an interest in Africa, using the East Africa Company to take over what are now Kenya and Uganda. The British crown formally took over in 1895 and renamed the area the East Africa Protectorate. Leopold II of Belgi",

McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 1927. There she started her career as the leader in the development of maize cytogenetics , the focus of her research for the rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis \u2014a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere , regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information . She was recognized among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944. Duri",

The Stations of the Cross , a devotional commemoration of Christ's carrying the Cross and of his execution , are often observed. Many Roman Catholic and some Protestant churches remove flowers from their altars, while crucifixes , religious statues, and other elaborate religious symbols are often veiled in violet fabrics in solemn observance of the event.

A hand appears and writes on the wall. The terrified Belshazzar calls for his wise men, but they are unable to read the writing. The queen advises him to send for Daniel , renowned for his wisdom. Daniel reminds Belshazzar that his father Nebuchadnezzar , when he became arrogant, was thrown down until he learned that God has sovereignty over the kingdom of men. Belshazzar had likewise blasphemed God, and so God sent this hand. Daniel then reads the message and interprets it: God has numbered Belshazzar's days, he has been weighed and found wanting, and his kingdom will be given to the Medes and the Persians .",

    "long_answer": "A death by natural causes , as recorded by coroners and on death certificates and associated documents, is one that is primarily attributed to an illness or an internal malfunction of the body not directly influenced by external forces. Contrary to the statement before, everything is natural at some point. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza (an infection) or a heart attack (an internal body malfunction) or sudden heart failure would be listed as having died from natural causes. Health departments discourage listing old age as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research. Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause, although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases .",

    "question": "what is the high surface tension of water due to",
    "long_answer": "At liquid\u2013air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion ) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion ). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Thus, the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces, which is probably where the term \"surface tension\" came from. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 \u00b0C) compared to that of most other liquids. Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity . Su",

Originally known as the \"Hinks Breed\" and \"The White Cavalier\", these dogs did not yet have the now-familiar \"egg face\", but kept the stop in the skull profile. The dog was immediately popular and breeding continued, using Dalmatian , Spanish Pointer , and Whippet to increase elegance and agility; and Borzoi and Rough Collie to reduce the stop. Hinks wanted his dogs white, and bred specifically for this. The first modern Bull Terrier is now recognised as \"Lord Gladiator\", from 1917, being the first dog with no stop at all.

    "long_answer": "Birds swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into their glandular stomach, also called the proventriculus , which is also sometimes referred to as the true stomach. This is the secretory part of the stomach. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the muscular stomach or ventriculus ). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In layman's terms, the gizzard 'chews' the food for the bird as it does not have teeth to chew food the way humans do. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of the carbohydrate-protein complex koilin , to protect the muscles in the gizzard. <",

    "long_answer": "microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts , allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.

    "question": "why is vitamin b12 anemia called megaloblastic anemia",
    "long_answer": "Megaloblastic anemia (or megaloblastic anaemia ) is an anemia (of macrocytic classification) that results from inhibition of DNA synthesis during red blood cell production. When DNA synthesis is impaired, the cell cycle cannot progress from the G2 growth stage to the mitosis (M) stage. This leads to continuing cell growth without division, which presents as macrocytosis. Megaloblastic anemia has a rather slow onset, especially when compared to that of other anemias. The defect in red cell DNA synthesis is most often due to hypovitaminosis, specifically a deficiency of vitamin B 12 and/or folic acid . Vitamin B 12 deficiency alone will not cause the syndrome in the presence of sufficient folate, as the mechanism is loss of B 12 dependent folate recycling, followed by folate-deficiency loss of nucleic acid synthesis (specifically thymine), leading to defects in DNA synthesis. Folic acid supplementation in the absence of vitamin B 12 prevents this type of anemia (although other vitamin B 12 -specific pathologies may be present). Loss of micronutrients may also be a cause. Copper deficiency resulting from an excess of zinc from unusually high oral consumption of zinc-containing denture-fixation creams has been found to be a cause.",

    "long_answer": "Geoffrey of Monmouth 's Latin work Historia Regum Britanniae ( History of the Kings of Britain ), completed c. 1138 . This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader . Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae . He incorporates Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon , his magician advisor Merlin , and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna at Tintagel , and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum , culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands . After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway , Denmark and Gaul . Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory naturally leads to a further confrontation between his empire and Rome's. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)\u2014whom he had left in charge of Britain\u2014has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. <DIV class=\"thumbinner\" styl",

On July 16, 1862, Congress passed legislation authorizing the U.S. federal government to purchase land for national cemeteries for military dead, and put the U.S. Army Quartermaster General in charge of this program. In May 1864, Union forces suffered large numbers of dead in the Battle of the Wilderness . Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs ordered that an examination of eligible sites be made for the establishment for a large new national military cemetery. Within weeks, his staff reported that Arlington Estate was the most suitable property in the area. The property was high and free from floods (which might unearth graves), it had a view of the District of Columbia, and it was aesthetically pleasing. It was also the home of the leader of the armed forces of the Confederate States of America, and denying Robert E. Lee use of his home after the war was a valuable political consideration. The first military burial at Arlington, for William Henry Christman , was made on May 13, 1864, close to what is now the northeast gate in Section 27. However, Meigs did not formally authorize establishment of burials until June 15, 1864. Arlington did not desegregate its burial practices until President Harry S.

As females have two X chromosomes, a defect in one is typically compensated for by the other, while males only have one X chromosome. Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye , optic nerve or parts of the brain .

    "question": "who broke the code of the enigma machine",
    "long_answer": "Around December 1932, Marian Rejewski of the Polish Cipher Bureau used the theory of permutations and flaws in the German military message procedures to break the message keys of the plugboard Enigma machine. Rejewski achieved this result without knowledge of the wiring of the machine, so the result did not allow the Poles to decrypt actual messages. The French had a spy with access to German cipher materials that included the daily keys used in September and October 1932. Those keys included the plugboard settings. The French gave the material to the Poles, and Rejewski used some of that material and the message traffic in September and October to solve for the unknown rotor wiring. Consequently, the Poles were able to build their own Enigma machines, which were called Enigma doubles . Rejewski was aided by cryptanalysts Jerzy R\u00f3\u017cycki and Henryk Zygalski , both of whom had been recruited with Rejewski from Pozna\u0144 University . The Polish Cipher Bureau developed techniques to defeat the plugboard and find all components of the daily key, which enabled the Cipher Bureau to read the German's Enigma messages. Over time, the German cryptographic procedures improved, and the Cipher Bureau developed techniques and designed mechanical devices to continue breaking the Enigma traffic. As part of that effort, the Poles exploited quirks of the rotors, compiled catalogs, built a cyclometer to help make a catalog with 100,000 entries, made Zygalski sheets and built the electro-mechanical cryptologic bomb to search for rotor settings. In 1938, the Germans added complexity to the Enigma machines that finally became too expensive for the Poles to counter. The Poles had six bomby , but when the Germans added two more rotors, ten times as many bomby were needed, but the Poles did not have the resources. On",

    "question": "when did the southern ocean become a thing",
    "long_answer": "By way of his voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), this situation has no scientific sense since it has different ecosystem and life from the three oceans mentioned before and is located on a southern portion of Earth, hence the name of an ocean. This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary. <",

Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the \"death strip\") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, \" fakir beds \" and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the \"will of the people\" in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.

    "question": "is there such a thing as a 1000 dollar bill",
    "long_answer": "Large-denomination currency (i.e., banknotes with a face value of $500 or higher) had been used in the United States since the late 18th century. The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina , authorized by legislation dated May 10, 1780. Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16, 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7, 1781. High-denomination treasury notes were issued, for example during the War of 1812 ($1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30, 1812). During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes. During the Federal banknote issuing period (1861 to present), the earliest high-denomination notes included three-year Interest-bearing notes of $500, $1,000, and $5,000, authorized by Congress on July 17, 1861. In total, 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high-denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates. The obverse of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures , allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts (e.g., liberty, justice), or a combination of both. The reverse designs range from abstract scroll-work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works. <",

They were disciples of John the Baptist and were converted by Aquila and Priscilla. According to Church tradition, after the Assumption of Mary , John went to Ephesus. From there he wrote the three epistles attributed to him. John was allegedly banished by the Roman authorities to the Greek island of Patmos , where, according to tradition, he wrote the Book of Revelation . According to Tertullian (in The Prescription of Heretics ) John was banished (presumably to Patmos) after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffering nothing from it. It is said that all in the audience of Colosseum were converted to Christianity upon witnessing this miracle.

Based on the Native American chief's daughter, Pocahontas (c. 1595\u20131617), and the settlement of Jamestown, Virginia in 1607. Pocahontas is displayed as a noble, independent and highly spiritual young woman. She expresses wisdom beyond her years and offers kindness and guidance to those around her. An adventurer and nature lover, in the film she appears to have shamanic powers since she was able to communicate with nature, spirits, and animals and understand foreign languages. In the sequel, Pocahontas, after hearing of John Smith's assumed death, is heartbroken. Despite this, she keeps her independent spirit and playfulness and is even much more mature and self-assured than she was in the first film. During her stay in England, she nearly loses herself in the hustle and bustle of the new world, consequently falling victim to western culture assimilation. But in the end, she bravely intends to sacrifice herself for her people's safety and returns to her homeland, finding herself, and love, once again. She was voiced by Irene Bedard and animated by Glen Keane while her singing was provided by Judy Kuhn . Like Jasmi",

    "question": "who took power by disobeying the roman senate",
    "long_answer": "Theodahad began an uprising against Emperor Justinian I and took the senators as hostages. Several senators were executed in 552 as a revenge for the death of the Ostrogothic king Totila . After Rome was recaptured by the Imperial ( Byzantine ) army, the Senate was restored, but the institution (like classical Rome itself) had been mortally weakened by the long war between the Byzantines and the Ostrogoths. Many senators had been killed and many of those who had fled to the East chose to remain there thanks to favorable legislation passed by emperor Justinian, who however abolished virtually all senatorial offices in Italy. The importance of the Roman Senate thus declined rapidly. In 578 and again in 580, the Senate sent envoys to Constantinople who delivered 3000 pounds of gold as a gift to the new emperor Tiberius II Constantinus along with a plea for help against the Langobards who had invaded Italy ten years earlier. Pope Gregory I , in a sermon from 593 (Senatus deest, or.18), lamented the almost complete disappearance of the senatorial order and the decline of the prestigious institution. It is not clearly known when the Roman Senate disappeared in the West, but it is known from Gregorian register that the Senate acclaimed new statues of Emperor Phocas and Empress Leontia in 603. The institution must have vanished by 630 when the Curia was transformed into a church by Pope Honorius I . The Senate did continue to exist in the Eastern Roman Empire 's capital Constantinople , however, having been instituted there during the reign of Constantine I . The Byzantine Senate survived until at least the mid-14th century, before the ancient institution finally vanished from history. <SPAN cla",

A year later they all begin receiving messages from the mysterious \"A\", who threatens to reveal their darkest secrets. Aria has just returned from Iceland after a year with her family and still feels unable to forgive her father who cheated on her mother, who's still unaware of it; she also discovers that her new English teacher (Ezra Fitz) is the same guy she met and made out with at a bar the day before. Hanna is now the \" it \" girl of the school and indulges in shoplifting, which gets her in trouble and forces her mother to sleep with a detective for her release; Spencer has feelings for her sister's fianc\u00e9 (Wren Kingston); Emily befriends a girl named Maya, who's just moved into Alison's house.

    "question": "what is the meaning of my name steven",
    "long_answer": "or Steven is a common English first name . It is particularly significant to Christians , as it belonged to Saint Stephen (Greek \u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 St\u00e9phanos ), an early disciple and deacon who, according to the Book of Acts , was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first martyr (or \" protomartyr \") of the Christian Church . The name \"Stephen\" (and its more common variant \"Steven\") is derived from Greek \u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( St\u00e9phanos ), a first name from the Greek word \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 ( st\u00e9phanos ), meaning \"wreath, crown\" and by extension \"reward, honor\", from the verb \u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ( st\u00e9phein ), \"to encircle, to wreathe\". In Ancient Greece , crowning wreaths (such as laurel wreaths ) were given to the winners of contests. Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any \"circle\"\u2014including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight, which is found in the Iliad of Homer .

For much of the year, these worms look like any other burrow-dwelling polychaete, but as the breeding season approaches, the worm undergoes a remarkable transformation as new, specialized segments begin to grow from its rear end until the worm can be clearly divided into two halves. The front half, the atoke, is asexual. The new rear half, responsible for breeding, is known as the epitoke. Each of the epitoke segments is packed with eggs and sperm and features a single eyespot on its surface. The beginning of the last lunar quarter is the cue for these animals to breed, and the epitokes break free from the atokes and float to the surface. The eye spots sense when the epitoke reaches the surface and the segments from millions of worms burst, releasing their eggs and sperm into the water. Another strange strategy is em",

    "question": "when do ty and amy get together season 2",
    "long_answer": "No. overall No. in season Title Directed by Written by Original air date Prod. code 14 1 \"Ghost Horse\" TW Peacocke Heather Conkie October 5, 2008 ( 2008-10-05 ) 201 Ty has been gone for four months, and things have changed at Heartland. There is a new ranch hand, a cowboy named Caleb O'Dell, who came with his roping horse, Shorty. At the start of the episode, Amy watches as two wild stallions fight for control of a herd, and takes the losing wild stallion back to Heartland to treat his injuries and tame him. Lou has plans to create a \"corporate equine retreat\" at Heartland, which Jack rejects as being a \"dude ranch\". She makes an effort to talk him around. At Amy's surprise sweet-sixteen party, Jack gets a call from someone and leaves the party. George Canyon , the country singer, makes a cameo as Mallory's dad Charlie and sings his hit song \"Just Like You\" at Amy's party. The episode ends with Jack and Ty getting out of the truck, to a less-than-warm welcome from Amy. 15 2 \"Letting Go\" TW Peacocke Leila Basen and David Preston October 12, 2008 ( 2008-10-12 ) 202 After his return, Ty promptly clashes with Caleb, as the latter has stepped into most of Ty's former duties. Caleb begins to emerge as a romantic rival to Ty for Amy, although Ashley is clearly interested in Caleb as well. Having given permission for Lou to establish her corporate equine retreat, Jack balks at tearing down old bunkhouses built by his grandfather, to make way for the new facilities. Lou gets a job as a waitress to prove she has no opportunity to use her skills if Jack won't let anything change at the ranch. Jack agrees to Lou renovating, rather than replacing, the old cabins for her corporate equine retreat. As a birthday present, Tim gives Amy a show jumping horse named Storm, and she is elated to receive such a gift. 16 3 \"Gift Horse\" Ron Murphy Leila Basen and David Preston October 19, 2008 ( 2008-10-19 ) 203 Amy tries to balance school, chores, and training for show jumping. Her father helps to coach her and Ty offers to help with chores and training Spartan, but Amy is struggling. Her grades in Earth Science slip while she tries to keep up with a show circuit that has competitions every weekend. (It should be noted that Earth Sciences is not actually a course offered in Alberta - parts of geological science are included in various other science courses in the province. This is one of a limited number of regional errors in this show.) Amy is forced to choose between her love of healing troubled horses and living up to her father's show jumping expectations. With no way to balance it all, Amy makes the hard decision to quit show jumping and sell Storm. This allows her to focus on her grades, chores, and work with horses. Meanwhile, Lou is searching for dude ranch horses and she is at odds with Tim over which horses to buy. He knows someone with Quarter Horses to sell, but Jack explains that they are hard for beginners to handle effectively. Amy suggests looking at resc",

An hour later, Class 1-A's bus stops for a restroom break. Suddenly, two women wearing cat-like costumes and a small boy appear. The women introduce themselves as the professional Hero Team, The Pussycats, while the boy is revealed to be Kota, an orphan in their care who despises heroes. Mandalay tells class 1-A that they must reach the training camp at the base of the mountain by midday or they will miss lunch. Despite their best efforts, class 1-A's progress is inhibited by earthen beasts throughout the forest, controlled by Pixie-Bob with her Quirk, and the students miss their deadline by hours. However, team Pussycats is satisfied with their performances, and they are offered dinner instead. Afterwards, Class 1-A go to the hot springs for a bath. Mineta tries to peek at the girls' bath side but is prevented by Kota; Kota accidentally sees the girls and faints, but is saved by Izuku. Izuku brings the unconscious Kota to the cabin and learns the story of his parents; pro heroes who died in the line of duty. 41 3 \"Kota\" \"K\u014dta-kun\" (\u6d38\u6c70\u304f\u3093) April 21, 2018 Class 1-A and 1-B continues training as the villains prepare to attack.

Muscular, one of the villains chances upon Kota at his secret hideout and tries to kill him, but is stopped by Izuku. Izuku is pushed to his limit in the fight but manages to defeat Muscular with a 1,000,000% Delaware Detroit Smash and saves Kota. Kota finally overcomes his prejudices due to Izuku's selflessness and calls him \"My Hero\". 43 5 \"Drive It Home, Iron Fist!!!\" \"Buchi komu tekken!!!\" (\u30d6\u30c1\u8fbc\u3080\u9244\u62f3!!!) May 5, 2018 After defeating Muscular, Izuku carries Kota back to the camp and runs into Eraserhead.

    "question": "when did the national drinking age become 21",
    "long_answer": "drunk driving fatalities. In 1984, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act , which required states to raise their ages for purchase and public possession to 21 by October 1986 or lose 10% of their federal highway funds. By mid-1988, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had raised their purchase ages to 21 (but not Puerto Rico, Guam, or the Virgin Islands, see Additional Notes below). South Dakota and Wyoming were the final two states to comply with the age 21 mandate. The current drinking age of 21 remains a point of contention among many Americans, because of it being higher than the age of majority (18 in most states) and higher than the drinking ages of most other countries. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is also seen as a congressional sidestep of the tenth amendment . Although debates have not been highly publicized, a few states have proposed legislation to lower their drinking age, while Guam has raised its drinking age to 21 in July 2010. <TABLE class=\"wikitable\" style=\"tex",

    "long_answer": "Trial by Jury , which runs only 30 minutes or so, was played last on a triple bill, on which the main attraction, La P\u00e9richole (starring Dolaro as the title character, Fred Sullivan as Don Andres and Walter H. Fisher as Piquillo), was preceded by the one-act farce Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata . The latter was immediately replaced by a series of other curtain raisers . The composer conducted the first night's performance, and the theatre's music director, B. Simmons, conducted thereafter. The composer's brother, Fred Sullivan, starred as the Learned Judge, with Nellie Bromley as the Plaintiff. One of the choristers in Trial by Jury , W. S. Penley , was promoted in November 1875 to the small part of the Foreman of the Jury and made a strong impact on audiences with his amusing facial expressions and gestures. In March 1876, he temporarily replaced Fred Sullivan as the Judge, when Fred's health declined from tuberculosis. With this start, Penley went on to a successful career as comic actor, culminating with the lead role in the record-breaking original production of Charley's Aunt . Fred Sullivan died in January 1877. <A href=\"/wiki/J",

The human auditory system averages the effects of SPL over a 600\u20131000 ms interval. A sound of constant SPL will be perceived to increase in loudness as samples of duration 20, 50, 100, 200 ms are heard, up to a duration of about 1 second at which point the perception of loudness will stabilize. For sounds of duration greater than 1 second, the moment-by-moment perception of loudness will be related to the average loudness during the preceding 600\u20131000 ms. For",

    "question": "where does clonal selection of t cells happen",
    "long_answer": "The theory states that in a pre-existing group of lymphocytes (specifically B cells), a specific antigen only activates (i.e. selection) its counter-specific cell so that particular cell is induced to multiply (producing its clones ) for antibody production. This activation occurs in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and the lymph nodes . In short the theory is an explanation of the mechanism for the generation of diversity of antibody specificity. The first experimental evidence came in 1958, when Gustav Nossal and Joshua Lederberg showed that one B cell always produces only one antibody. The idea turned out to be the foundation of molecular immunology, especially in adaptive immunity .",

(The terms \"ground\" and \"earth\" are used synonymously here. \"Ground\" is more common in North American English, and \"earth\" is more common in British English.) Under normal conditions, a grounding conductor does not carry current. Grounding is an integral path for home wiring also because it causes circuit breakers to trip more quickly (ie, GFI), which is safer. Adding new grounds requires a qualified electrician with information particular to a power company distribution region. <",

    "question": "who sings walk through this world with me",
    "long_answer": "The song \"Walk Through This World With Me\" would become a number one hit for Jones in 1967, his first chart topper in five years. According to Bob Allen's book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend , Jones was less than enthusiastic about the \"musically middle-of-the-road love ballad that was almost inspirational in its unabashedly optimistic and romantic sentiments - a far cry from 'The Window Up Above,'\" and it was only at his producer H.W. \"Pappy\" Daily's insistence that he recorded the song at all. In the 1994 retrospective Golden Hits , Jones states that he was unhappy with his singing on the LP version and, after the song started getting heavy airplay in Chicago , he told his manager Pappy Daily that he wanted to recut it. \"The single record on it was different, even though it was almost the same, I did a little better job singing the single than I did on the album.\" Jones would perform the song in concert throughout his career, often as part of an \"oldies\" medley. <",

The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer for Easter through prayer , doing penance , mortifying the flesh , repentance of sins, almsgiving , and self-denial .

Long bones, especially the femur and tibia , are subjected to most of the load during daily activities and they are crucial for skeletal mobility. They grow primarily by elongation of the diaphysis , with an epiphysis at each end of the growing bone. The ends of epiphyses are covered with hyaline cartilage (\"articular cartilage\"). The longitudinal growth of long bones is a result of endochondral ossification at the epiphyseal plate . Bone growth in length is stimulated by the production of growth hormone (GH), a secretion of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland .",

The policy prohibited military personnel from discriminating against or harassing closeted homosexual or bisexual service members or applicants, while barring openly gay , lesbian , or bisexual persons from military service. This relaxation of legal restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the armed forces was mandated by United States federal law Pub.L. 103\u2013160 ( 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 654 ), which was signed November 30, 1993. The policy prohibited people who \"demonstrate a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts\" from serving in the armed forces of the United States , because their presence \"would create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability\".

For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10 and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a day, month and year. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that is beyond the \"seven plus-or-minus two\" memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers.",

The collapse of the Mughal era saw the rise of powerful men who associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, affirming the regal and martial form of the caste ideal, and it also reshaped many apparently casteless social groups into differentiated caste communities. The British Raj furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration. Between 1860 and 1920, the British segregated Indians by caste, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes. Social unrest during the 1920s led to a change in this policy. From then on, the colonial administration began a policy of positive discrimination by reserving a certain percentage of government jobs for the lower castes.",

According to Jagger, \"the names [in the song] are historical, but it was really unconscious that they should fit together from the same period.\" At the time, it was widely thought that an inspiration for the song was Jane Ormsby-Gore , daughter of David Ormsby-Gore , former British ambassador in Washington, who later married Michael Rainey , founder of the Hung on You boutique in Chelsea that was frequented by the Stones. Its most impactful development was by Jones, no longer the principal musical force for the band, searching for methods to improve upon The Rolling Stones' musical textures. He expressed an intrigue in incorporating culturally diverse instruments into the band's music, investigating the sitar , koto , marimba , and testing electronics. In the press Jones talked about applying the Appalachian dulcimer into compositions, although he seemed uncertain of the instrument, saying \"It's an old English instrument used at the beginning of the century\". The dulcimer was first brought to his attention in March 1966 when Jones began listening to recordings of Richard Fari\u00f1a . The influence of these recordings would manifest itself in Aftermath , where Jones performed with the dulcimer on two tracks, \"I Am Waiting\" and, more distinctively, \"Lady Jane\". This later contributed to Jones's status as an early pioneer in world music , and effectively shifted the band from blues rock to a versatile pop group. <S",

When Andy went off on his long boat trip, Toby's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in Nellie Bertram and his belief that he'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case (a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was, in fact, strangled and nearly killed by him). In the series finale, it's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone (it's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him) and Toby then moved to New York where he's trying to become a novelist and has six roommates. Toby surprises his former co-workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he's not being filmed for the documentary anymore. He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela's wedding, saying of what's bad in his life that \"It's everything!\", but he seems cheered a little when the group insists he join them for post-wedding festivities. In a photo gallery NBC released of \"where are they now?\" info-bits for the characters, it's revealed that Toby has returned to his destiny by taking on an HR position at a TJ Maxx store. <SPAN class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Reference",

    "question": "what is maggie's dads name in the walking dead",
    "long_answer": "Maggie Greene , portrayed by Lauren Cohan , is Hershel's daughter and Beth's elder half-sister. A tomboy at heart, she scavenges supplies from the local town. She develops strong feelings for Glenn, impressed by his bravery and loyalty to the group. After the fall of the farm, she settles 8 months later at the prison with the rest of the group. She and Glenn are later captured and interrogated by Merle and The Governor, who forces her to undress and threatens her with rape to intimidate Glenn into giving up information. After a rescue mission, she continues to be proactive in defending the prison during The Governor's attacks, killing several snipers and soldiers to protect the prison survivors. She soon marries Glenn. When Glenn is infected by the deadly influenza virus that has spread across the prison and her father risks exposure by caring for the sick, she is angry and frustrated but is able to help when she rushes in to rescue her father and husband from the reanimated infected that overrun the quarantine zone. The Governor returns to the prison and Maggie witnesses her father's execution in horror. She defends the prison against The Governor's militia before escaping the overrun compound with Sasha and Bob, unsure if Glenn and her sister are alive or not. Deciding that Glenn is alive, Maggie searches for and finds him, and joins the mission to D.C. for a cure. She receives news that her sister is still alive, only to be left heartbroken once she arrives too late to meet her, as Beth has just died. Maggie becomes depressed after her sister's death, but begins to recover before the group arrived at Alexandria. Once in Alexandria, Maggie acts as Deanna's assistant. She tries to persuade Deanna not to exile Rick and also prevents Sasha from killing Gabriel. Maggie later discovers she is pregnant and worries with the possibility of Glenn's death. When they reunite, she joins the group to go to the Hilltop Colony where she negotiates a deal with Gregory for half of their supplies. When Rick initiates a plan to take out the Saviors, Maggie and Carol are captured by a female group of Saviors and Maggie is forced to kill them, as well as some others, to protect herself and the baby. She forms a maternal bond with Enid. When Enid gives Maggie a haircut, she collapses on the floor in pain and she is taken with a group to reach the Hilltop to see a doctor. Maggie, along with Glenn, Rosita, Daryl, Michonne, Abraham, Rick, Sasha, Carl, Eugene and Aaron, is forced to kneel before Negan before they can reach the Hilltop. Maggie is forced to watch as Negan kills Glenn as punishment for Daryl's strike. A devastated Maggie tells Rick to prepare to fight Negan as she attempts to collect Glenn's body. Glenn's death ultimately helps Maggie grow stronger. Maggie moves to the Hilltop for medical treatment along with Sasha and Enid, and eventually takes leadership over Gregory. At the end of the All Out War arc, Maggie is secretly plotting behind Rick's back along",

    "long_answer": "A retractor is a surgical instrument used to separate the edges of a surgical incision or wound , or to hold back underlying organs and tissues so that body parts under the incision may be accessed. The general term retractor usually describes a simple handheld steel tool possessing a curved, hooked , or angled blade and fitted with a comfortable handle , that when in place maintains the desired position of a given region of tissue. These simple retractors may be handheld, clamped in place, or suspended at the end of a robotic arm . Retractors can also be self-retaining and not need to be held once inserted by having two or more opposing blades or hooks which are separated via spring , ratchet , worm gear or other method. The term retractor is also used to describe distinct, hand-cranked devices such as rib spreaders (also known as thoracic retractors, or distractors) with which surgeons may forcefully drive tissues apart to obtain exposure. For specialized situations such as spinal surgery , retractors have been fitted both with suction and with fiberoptic lights to keep a surgical wound dry and illuminated.",

The white in the centre signifies a lasting peace and hope for union between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland. The flag, as a whole, is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as the entitlement of every person born in Ireland to be part of the independent Irish nation, regardless of ethnic origin, religion or political conviction.

The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth , the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1 , on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet Space Program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight ( Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1 ) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Aleksei Leonov ) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station ( Salyut 1 ) in 1971.",

The 29th Division was to land at Helles on the tip of the peninsula and then advance upon the forts at Kilitbahir . The Anzacs, with the 3rd Infantry Brigade spearheading the assault, were to land north of Gaba Tepe on the Aegean coast, from where they could advance across the peninsula, cutting off the Ottoman troops in Kilitbahir. The small cove in and around which they landed became known as \" Anzac Cove \". This sector of the Gallipoli Peninsula became known as Anzac; the area held by the British and French became known as the Helles sector or Helles. The French made a diversionary landing at Kum Kale on the Asian shore before re-embarking, to hold the eastern area of the Helles sector. The Royal Naval Division simulated landing preparations at Bulair as a diversion and a New Zealand officer, Bernard Freyberg , swam ashore under fire to light flares, to distract the defenders from the real landings; Freyberg was later awarded the Distinguished Service Order .

Trinitarians view these as elements of the codified doctrine. Ignatius of Antioch provides early support for the Trinity around 110, exhorting obedience to \"Christ, and to the Father, and to the Spirit\". Justin Martyr (AD 100\u2013c. 165) also writes, \"in the name of God, the Father and Lord of the universe, and of our Saviour Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit\". The first of the early church fathers to be recorded using the word \"Trinity\" was Theophilus of Antioch writing in the late 2nd century.

The first defence of the doctrine of the Trinity was in the early 3rd century by the early church father Tertullian . He explicitly defined the Trinity as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and defended the Trinitarian theology against the \" Praxean \" heresy.

    "question": "where is first hockey club set up in world",
    "long_answer": "A game called hockey was played in English public schools in the early 19th century. Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey. That old-fashioned game, now very uncommon in England, except at schools... . Hockey's popularity increased with that of other team games. A version of the game played in south-east London was rougher than the modern version, played on a very large field (247m by 64m), and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks. The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs, especially Teddington Hockey Club . The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise, but did not particularly care for football . In 1870, members of the Teddington cricket club, who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park , were looking for a winter activity. They experimented with a \u2018stick\u2019 game, based loosely on the rules of association football. Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball , so allowing smooth and predictable motion. By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game, including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it. An association was formed in 1875, which dissolved after seven years, but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College, Cambridge . Blackheath were one of the founder members, but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union. The Union failed, but the Association grew rapidly. Th",

    "long_answer": "The reader must interpret their dialogue and body language to infer their backgrounds and their attitudes with respect to the situation at hand, and their attitudes toward one another. From the outset of the story, the contentious nature of the couple's conversation indicates resentment and unease. Some critics have written that the dialogue is a distillation of the contrasts between stereotypical male and female relationship roles: in the excerpt above, for instance, the woman draws the comparison with white elephants, but the hyper-rational male immediately denies it, dissolving the bit of poetry into objective realism with \"I've never seen one.\" By saying, \"No, you wouldn't have\" she implies he hadn't had a child before, or hadn't allowed birth in the past. She also asks his permission to order a drink. Throughout the story, the woman is distant; the American is rational. There may be more serious problems with the relationship than the purely circumstantial. While most critics have espoused relatively straightforward interpretations of the dialogue, a few have argued for alternate scenarios. <",

    "question": "what is a good basketball field goal percentage",
    "long_answer": "Field goal percentage in basketball is the ratio of field goals made to field goals attempted . Its abbreviation is FG% . Although three-point field goal percentage is often calculated separately, three-point field goals are included in the general field goal percentage. Instead of using scales of 0 to 100%, the scale .000 to 1.000 is commonly used. A higher field goal percentage denotes higher efficiency. In basketball, a FG% of .500 (50%) or above is considered a good percentage, although this criterion does not apply equally to all positions. Guards usually have lower FG% than forwards and centers . Field goal percentage does not completely tell the skill of a player, but a low field goal percentage can indicate a poor offensive player or a player who takes many difficult shots. In the NBA , Center Shaquille O'Neal has a high career FG% (around .580) because he plays near the basket making many high percentage layups and slam dunks . Guard Allen Iverson often had a low FG% (around .420) because he took the bulk of his team's shot attempts, even with high difficulty shots.",

However, it was revealed that these winds did not impact any structures, and as a result the tornado was downgraded to EF3 based on damage. However, another possible contender for the widest tornado as measured by radar was the F4 Mulhall tornado in north-central Oklahoma which occurred during the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak . The diameter of the maximum winds (over 110 mph (49 m/s)) was over 5,200 feet (1,600 m) as measured by a DOW radar.

    "long_answer": "The innate immune system , also known as the non-specific immune system or in-born immunity system , is an important subsystem of the overall immune system that comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms. The cells of the innate system recognize and respond to pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system , the system does not provide long-lasting immunity to the host. Innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection, and are found in all classes of plant and animal life.",

Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time.

February 19, 2017 TBA Basil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh ( \u30ed\u30a6 , R\u014d ) , the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Zen\u014d-sama is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Zen\u014d-sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender ( \u30e9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c0 , Rabenda ) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match.

Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie.

    "question": "when did canada break away from the british empire",
    "long_answer": "Treaty of Paris (1763) which ceded New France , of which Canada was a part, to the British Empire . Gradually, other territories, colonies, and provinces that were part of British North America would be added to Canada. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 enlarged the colony of Canada under the name of the Province of Quebec , which with the Constitutional Act 1791 became known as The Canadas . With the Act of Union 1840 Upper and Lower Canada were joined to become the United Province of Canada . Later, with Confederation in 1867, the British maritime colonies of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were joined with the British colony of Canada to form the Dominion of Canada , which was subsequently divided into four provinces, Ontario , Quebec , New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. A number of other British colonies, such as Newfoundland and British Columbia , and large territories such as Rupert's Land initially remained outside of the newly formed federation. Over time, the remaining colonies and territories within British North America came under the control of Canada until the current geographic extent of the country was reached when Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949. Although confederation in 1867 led to an enlarged Dominion with increased autonomy over domestic affairs, Canada still remained a colony within the British Empire and was thus subordinate to the British Parliament until the enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. This statute recognized Canada as an independent peer coequal with the United Kingdom, and thus provided the Parliament of Canada with legislative sovereignty over all federal matters except the power to change the constitutional laws of Canada which remained under the purview of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Canada's final vestige of legal dependence on the United Kingdom was terminated in 1982 with the enactment of the Canada Act , subsequently providing Canada with full legal sovereignty completely independent of the United Kingdom.",

    "question": "what is the big five trait of conscientiousness",
    "long_answer": "The Big Five personality traits , also known as the five factor model ( FFM ), is a model based on common language descriptors of personality . When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone described as conscientious is more likely to be described as \"always prepared\" rather than \"messy\". This theory is based therefore on the association between words but not on neuropsychological experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and therefore suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human personality and psyche . The five factors have been defined as openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness , and neuroticism , often represented by the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE . Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated and more specific primary factors. For example, extraversion is said to include such related qualities as gregariousness, assertiveness, excitement seeking, warmth, activity, and positive emotions.",

    "question": "during what time in history were gothic stories popular",
    "long_answer": "Gothic fiction , which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror , is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror , death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole , with his 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto , subtitled (in its second edition) \"A Gothic Story\". The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century where, following Walpole, it was further developed by Clara Reeve , Ann Radcliffe , William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis . The genre had much success in the 19th century, as witnessed in prose by Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein and the works of Edgar Allan Poe as well as Charles Dickens with his novella , A Christmas Carol , and in poetry in the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Lord Byron and Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era , is Bram Stoker 's Dracula . The name Gothic refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture , in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German Schauerroman and the French Georgia . <",

    "long_answer": "Brentford 3\u20131 on aggregate in the semi-finals, moving them into the playoff final on 29 May 2005 at the Millennium Stadium . 41,000 Wednesdayites descended on Cardiff for what was the biggest game in twelve years for the club. They weren't to be disappointed as the Owls took a 1\u20130 lead through Jon-Paul McGovern on the stroke of halftime . However, Hartlepool fought back and took a 2\u20131 lead with 20 minutes of the game remaining. Sturrock made a brave triple substitution bringing on 18-year-old striker Drew Talbot and the Owls' top scorer of the season, Steve MacLean (who had been out injured for the previous three months and had not kicked a ball). They combined with 10 minutes left as the Owls levelled the game 2\u20132. Talbot was adjudged to have been pushed down inside the box and Sheffield Wednesday were awarded a controversial penalty, which also resulted in the dismissal of Hartlepool player Westwood. MacLean duly slotted home the resultant penalty. They went on to win 4\u20132 after extra time, goals from Glenn Whelan and Drew Talbot , achieving promotion to the Championship. On 17 April 2006, Sheffield Wednesday retained their place in the Champ",

    "question": "what is the meaning of anger in english",
    "long_answer": "Anger or wrath is an intense emotional response. It is an emotion that involves a strong uncomfortable and hostile response to a perceived provocation, hurt or threat. Anger can occur when a person feels their personal boundaries are being or are going to be violated. Some have a learned tendency to react to anger through retaliation as a way of coping. Raymond Novaco of University of California Irvine, who since 1975 has published a plethora of literature on the subject, stratified anger into three modalities: cognitive (appraisals), somatic - affective (tension and agitations), and behavioral (withdrawal and antagonism). William DeFoore, an anger-management writer, described anger as a pressure cooker: we can only apply pressure against our anger for a certain amount of time until it explodes.",

It determines the atomic mass of atoms . Because protons and neutrons both are baryons , the mass number A is identical with the baryon number B as of the nucleus as of the whole atom or ion . The mass number is different for each different isotope of a chemical element . This is not the same as the atomic number ( Z ) which denotes the number of protons in a nucleus, and thus uniquely identifies an element.

President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the bill, but the House of Representatives overrode the veto, and the Senate did so as well the next day.

In the lands of the Sokoto Caliphate , conquered by the British Empire at the turn of the century, Lugard instituted a system whereby external, military, and tax control was operated by the British, while most every other aspect of life was left to local pre-British aristocracies who may have sided with the British during or after their conquest. The theory behind this solution to a very practical problem (a problem referred to as 'The Native Problem' by Mahmood Mamdani in his work Citizen and Subject) of domination by a tiny group of foreigners of huge populations is laid out in Lugard's influential work, The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa . <",

    "question": "who did the united states acquire texas from",
    "long_answer": "Republic of Texas was annexed to the United States of America, becoming the 28th U.S. state. Border disputes between the new state and Mexico, which had never recognized Texas independence and still considered the area a renegade Mexican state, led to the Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848). When the war concluded, Mexico relinquished its claim on Texas, as well as other regions in what is now the southwestern United States. Texas' annexation as a state that tolerated slavery had caused tension in the United States among slave states and those that did not allow slavery. The tension was partially defused with the Compromise of 1850, in which Texas ceded some of its territory to the federal government to become non-slave-owning areas but gained El Paso <DIV id=\"toc\" class=\"",

    "question": "who is pictured on the back of the two dollar bill",
    "long_answer": "United States two-dollar bill ($2) is a current denomination of U.S. currency. The third U.S. President (1801\u201309), Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note. The reverse features an engraving of the painting Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill's pre-1929 life as a large-sized note, it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or \"Coin\" Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size, the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note. Production went on until 1966, when the series was discontinued. Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design. Two-dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand. This comparative scarcity in circulation, coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation, has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases. <DIV id=",

    "long_answer": "A circuit breaker is an automatically operated electrical switch designed to protect an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current , typically resulting from an overload or short circuit . Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse , which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse , as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).",

Later that offseason, the Patriots made a trade which sent Cassel to the Kansas City Chiefs , who signed him to a 6-year, $62.7 million contract in July 2009.

    "question": "when did the doctrine of original sin begin",
    "long_answer": "The concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by Irenaeus , Bishop of Lyon in his controversy with certain dualist Gnostics . Other church fathers such as Augustine also developed the doctrine, seeing it as based on the New Testament teaching of Paul the Apostle ( Romans 5:12\u201321 and 1 Corinthians 15:22 ) and the Old Testament verse of Psalms 51:5 . Tertullian , Cyprian , Ambrose and Ambrosiaster considered that humanity shares in Adam's sin, transmitted by human generation. Augustine's formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers , such as Martin Luther and John Calvin , who equated original sin with concupiscence (or \"hurtful desire\"), affirming that it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom. The Jansenist movement, which the Catholic Church declared to be heretical, also maintained that original sin destroyed freedom of will . <",

Both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court ratified a number of the amendments (the Senate adopted 10 of 12 and the House 9 of 12), but failed to reconcile their two lists or to send official notice to the Secretary of State of the ones they did agree upon. Both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly voted to ratify Articles Three through Twelve but failed to reconcile their bills after disagreeing over whether to ratify Articles One and Two. All three later ratified the Constitutional amendments originally known as Articles Three through Twelve as part of the 1939 commemoration of the Bill of Rights' sesquicentennial: Massachusetts on March 2, Georgia on March 18, and Connecticut on April 19.

Webber assigns Cristina to teach him when he notices that he's bleeding. Meredith and Derek attempt to work on their \"happily ever after\", and Meredith is plagued with a recurring nightmare where Derek dies. The ER is failed with car crash victims due to a snow storm. The attendings are stressed over Seattle Grace's ranking of number twelve. Derek's professional relationship with Rose takes a hit following their break up. Lexie is shocked to discover that Meredith has slept with George, especially due to her feelings towards him. Mark finds out about Lexie's feelings for George. An awkward atmosphere exists between Erica and Callie following their kiss. After an argument with Meredith, Cristina slips over and an icicle hanging overhead drops down and impales her. Cristina is annoyed when Webber orders her interns to treat her following her impalement. Owen ends up treating her, and after he turns down a job at the hospital, kisses her. Alex is annoyed with Izzie after he finds out that she told Meredith that she thought he was changing. Lexie is devastated when she discovers that George doesn't have feelings for her. Rose accidentally stabs Derek with a scalpel in the palm of his hand, and Derek is further frustrated when Webber takes treatment advice from Owen over Derek's patient. However, when the treatment threatens the patient's life, Callie freezes until Erica is able to encourage her to remember her research. Webber continues to push a hard line of trying to save every patient and berates Meredith when she is unable to do so. 81 3 \"Here Comes the Flood\" Michael Pressman Krista Vernoff October 9, 2008 ( 2008-10-09 ) 14.54 There are leaks all over the surgical floor, but Webber is reluctant to remove any patients, until the roof in an operating room collapses on one.

Webber holds a meeting with all of the doctors and explains the new teaching system. After the meeting he shakes up all of the doctors' specialties, taking them off their own cases and putting them on to different ones. Alex worries after his patient breaks hospital policy and injures himself while on his watch, and things get worse after he is electrocuted in a CT machine following water hitting the electrics. Meredith treats a bubbly girl with liver cancer, and Meredith is devastated when the cancer is worse than it seemed.

It is tied around the bull's flank. Contrary to popular belief, the flank strap is not tied around the bull's testicles. This rope is to encourage the bull to use its hind legs more in a bucking motion, as this is a true test of a rider's skill in maintaining the ride. If it is applied improperly a rider may request to ride again, as the bull will not buck well if the flank strap is too tight.

    "question": "what is the population of giraffes in africa",
    "long_answer": "Nubian giraffe was the most threatened of all giraffes; as of 2010 , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa. Giraffe Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. The UN backed Convention of Migratory Species selected giraffes for protection in 2017. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985, with around 1,144 in captivity.

    "question": "what do you mean by cis and trans isomerism",
    "long_answer": "Cis \u2013 trans isomerism , also known as geometric isomerism or configurational isomerism, is a term used in organic chemistry . The prefixes \" cis \" and \" trans \" are from Latin. In the context of chemistry, cis indicates that the functional groups are on the same side of the carbon chain while trans conveys that functional groups are on opposing sides of the carbon chain. Cis-trans isomers are stereoisomers , that is, pairs of molecules which have the same formula but whose functional groups are rotated into a different orientation in three-dimensional space. It is not to be confused with E \u2013 Z isomerism , which is an absolute stereochemical description, and only to be used with alkenes. In general, stereoisomers contain double bonds that cannot rotate, or they may contain ring structures, where the rotation of bonds is restricted or prevented. Cis and trans isomers occur both in organic molecules and in inorganic coordination complexes. Cis and trans descriptors are not used for cases of conformational isomerism where the two geometric forms easily interconvert, such as most open-chain single-bonded structures; instead, the terms \" syn \" and \" anti \" would be used.

The common English phrasing is \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". A similar form of the phrase appeared in a Catholic catechism around 1567 (certainly in the reprint of 1583). The Golden Rule is stated positively numerous times in the Hebrew Pentateuch as well as the Prophets and Writings. Leviticus 19:18 (\"Forget about the wrong things people do to you, and do not try to get even. Love your neighbor as you love yourself.\"; see also Great Commandment ) and Leviticus 19:34 (\"But treat them just as you treat your own citizens.

    "question": "who sang west texas town of el paso",
    "long_answer": "\" El Paso \" is a country and western ballad written and originally recorded by Marty Robbins , and first released on Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs in September 1959. It was released as a single the following month, and became a major hit on both the country and pop music charts , reaching number one in both at the start of 1960. It won the Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording in 1961 , and remains Robbins' best-known song. It is widely considered a genre classic for its gripping narrative which ends in the death of its protagonist, its shift from past to present tense, haunting harmonies by vocalists Bobby Sykes and Jim Glaser (of the Glaser Brothers ) and the eloquent and varied Spanish guitar accompaniment by Grady Martin that lends the recording a distinctive Tex-Mex feel. The name of the character Feleena was based upon a schoolmate of Robbins in the fifth grade\u2014Fidelina Martinez. <P",

After returning to his relieved family and friends, Michael finds Sam and Fi in dire need of his help to protect a lawyer from his client\u2019s ex-boyfriend, who is a key member of a dangerous biker gang. Though slightly disappointed his team soldiered on without him, Michael steps in to give the gang\u2019s hardened leader the impression that letting the lawyer live is in the organization\u2019s best interests, even if the ex-boyfriend disagrees. In his first official mission for Vaughn, Michael follows a lead on a key member of the group that freed Simon, but he is displeased to find that in doing so he has burned a counter-intelligence agent named Jesse Porter . 46 2 \"Fast Friends\" Dennie Gordon Rashad Raisani June 10, 2010 ( 2010-06-10 ) BN402 5.67 As part of his investigation for Vaughn, and having determined not to see a fellow spy marginalized like he was, a conflicted Michael formally meets Jesse Porter, who, in his own attempt to find whoever burned him, has run into trouble with a Chinese drug dealer who believes Jesse stole money from him. With the dealer under government protection, and Jesse keen on being part of the action, the challenge for Michael and the team is to get the drug runners out of Jesse\u2019s hair while keeping him alive, which eventually requires making the boss believe the theft was an inside job. Now that Jesse is part of the team, Michael is forced into high gear to balance his work for a pressing Vaughn with the reality that the person Jesse wants to kill is now right under his nose. 47 3 \"Made Man\" Jeffrey Donovan Alfredo Barrios, Jr. June 17, 2010 ( 2010-06-17 ) BN403 5.31 While helping Jesse continue tracking leads from his work at the intelligence office, Michael and the team discover that vicious mobsters, who have connections in New York, are using the local port for racketeering.

However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other. The story starts in medias res . The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or (anachronistically) a psychiatrist. In any case, the narrator explains himself in great detail. What follows is a study of terror but, more specifically, the memory of terror, as the narrator is relating events from the past. The first word of the story, \"True!\", is an admission of his guilt, as well as an assurance of reliability. This introduction also serves to gain the reader's attention.

A recurring joke involves Wimpy's attempts to con other patrons of the diner into buying his meal for him. His best-known catchphrase started in 1931 as, \"Cook me up a hamburger. I'll pay you Thursday.\" In 1932, this then became the famous, \"I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.\" The phrase was also slightly altered in the episode \"Spree Lunch\" to \"I'll have a hamburger, for which I will gladly pay you Tuesday.\" This phrase is now commonly used to illustrate financial irresponsibility and still appears in modern comedies such as The Drew Carey Show and The Office .

    "question": "where is the pns located in the body",
    "long_answer": "The peripheral nervous system ( PNS ) is one of the two components of the nervous system , the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord . The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull , or by the blood\u2013brain barrier , which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system . In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina . The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon . Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS. The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic .",

It featured a ten-round box magazine which was loaded with the .303 British cartridge manually from the top, either one round at a time or by means of five-round chargers . The Lee\u2013Enfield was the standard issue weapon to rifle companies of the British Army and other Commonwealth nations in both the First and Second World Wars (these Commonwealth nations included Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India and South Africa, among others). Although officially replaced in the UK with the L1A1 SLR in 1957, it remained in widespread British service until the early/mid-1960s and the 7.62 mm L42 sniper variant remained in service until the 1990s. As a standard-issue infantry rifle, it is still found in service in the armed forces of some Commonwealth nations, notably with the Bangladesh Police, which makes it the second longest-serving military bolt-action rifle still in official service, after the Mosin\u2013Nagant .

This is in contrast to a constructive plate boundary (also known as a mid-ocean ridge or spreading center). As a result of pressure, friction, and plate material melting in the mantle , earthquakes and volcanoes are common near destructive boundaries, where subduction zones or an area of continental collision (depending on the nature of the plates involved) occurs. The subducting plate in a subduction zone is normally oceanic crust , and moves beneath the other plate, which can be made of either oceanic or continental crust . During collisions between two continental plates, large mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas are formed. In other regions, a divergent boundary or transform faults may be present.",

T cells are critical to the adaptive immune system , where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum , in front of the heart and behind the sternum . Histologically , each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T cells. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin (derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells ). Developing T cells are referred to as thymocytes and are of hematopoietic origin. Stromal cells include epithelial cells of the thymic cortex and medulla, and dendritic cells .",

Following the 1992\u201393 season the NBA increased steel brace strength and increased stability of the backboard to prevent the hoop from falling down after Shaquille O'Neal broke two goal standards the previous season (although the glass remained intact, welds in the goal standard failed). The aforementioned technical foul was also introduced at the time. During the NCAA tournament in 1996, Darvin Ham shattered a backboard while playing for Texas Tech against North Carolina . Robert Traylor , while playing for the Michigan Wolverines , shattered a backboard against the Ball State Cardinals in 1996.

    "question": "chemical signals that act from cell to cell are called",
    "long_answer": "Intracrine signals are produced by the target cell that stay within the target cell. Autocrine signals are produced by the target cell, are secreted, and affect the target cell itself via receptors. Sometimes autocrine cells can target cells close by if they are the same type of cell as the emitting cell. An example of this are immune cells . Juxtacrine signals target adjacent (touching) cells. These signals are transmitted along cell membranes via protein or lipid components integral to the membrane and are capable of affecting either the emitting cell or cells immediately adjacent. Paracrine signals target cells in the vicinity of the emitting cell. Neurotransmitters represent an example. Endocrine signals target distant cells. Endocrine cells produce hormones that travel through the blood to reach all parts of the body. <",

    "question": "where did the band tool get their name from",
    "long_answer": "[3] After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started jamming together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by Tom Morello , an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he \"felt kinda sorry for them,\" as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the pseudophilosophy \"lachrymology\". Although \"lachrymology\" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: \"Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve.\" After almost two years of",

    "question": "when was the first children's hospital built",
    "long_answer": "Prior to the 19th century hospital reforms, the well-being of the child was thought to be in the hands of the mother; therefore, there was little discussion of children's medicine, and as a result next to no widespread formal institutions which focused on healing children. There were however centres which focused on helping abandoned children and offering care in hopes that these children might survive into adulthood. Some examples include orphanages, dispensaries, and foundling hospitals. Florence's Hospital of the Innocent ( Ospedale degli Innocenti ) was originally a charity based orphanage which opened in 1445; its aim was to nurse sick and abandoned infants back to health. A later example and better established institution whose goal it was to help rehabilitate infants was the Foundling Hospital founded by Thomas Coram in 1741. Foundling hospitals were set up to receive abandoned infants, nurse them back to health, teach them a trade or skill, and integrate them back into society. Coram's foundling hospital was revolutionary because it was one of the United Kingdoms first children charities. Moreover, it was largely made successful by the powerful people who donated money to the hospital. Coram's hospital would eventually be faced with the fact that the number of infants needing care outweighed their hospitals capacity. In order to accommodate the number of children in need, there were attempts to set up similar hospitals throughout the UK; they ultimately were unsuccessful due to the lack of funding. Simultaneously, dispensaries which were also funded by donations were being opened in order to provide medicine and medical attention to those who could not afford private care. Dispensaries and foundling hospitals were the earliest forms of what would later become children's hospitals. The establishing of the Foundling Hospital by Thomas Coram was a direct response to the high infant mortality rate in London, England. Although foundling hospitals acknowledged the high infant mortality rate, infant mortality would not be addressed in a wide spread way until the early 19th century when children's hospitals would begin to open in Vienna, Moscow, Prague, Berlin, and various other major cities throughout Europe. <",

McQuarrie's designs were based on the concepts created by Ken Adam to feature a vessel with a flattened secondary hull. Fuller wanted \"something distinct about what our Star Trek was going to look\" like, and after seeing McQuarrie's design \"saw sort of harder lines of a ship and started talking about race cars and Lamborghinis in the '70s and James Bond cars and started working on the designs, taking those inspirations and coming up with something completely unique to us.\" The design for the Discovery went through several revisions and refinements before the final version was approved in December 2016. The sickbay on the Discovery was inspired by that of the Enterprise from the original series. Other Federation starships created for the show include the USS Shenzhou and the USS Europa . Sets for the Discovery ' s interiors were described as a \"tangle of corridors and rooms\", and were designed to match with the exterior design of the ship, so \"the rooms [could believably] fit inside the house\", but there was some artistic license taken in places. The graphics used for the Starfleet computer systems were designed to be believably more advanced than modern technology, but to also \"honor the look and feel\" of the designs used in previous series. The initial colors allowed for the graphics were mostly restricted to blues, with the intention of these becoming more colorful the closer the series gets to the time period of the original series.

    "question": "where does the last name corbett come from",
    "long_answer": "Corbett is an English-language surname . It is derived from the Anglo-Norman French , Middle English , and Old French corbet , which is a diminutive of corb , meaning \" raven \". The surname probably originated from a nickname referring to someone with dark hair or a dark complexion like a raven's. The surname was brought to England from Normandy , and spread to [cotland in the 12th century, and into northern Ireland in the 17th century. Early instances of the name are Corbet in Shropshire , recorded in Domesday Book in 1086; Corbet in Shropshire , recorded in the Assize Rolls of Worcestershire in 1158; and le Corbet in Oxfordshire , recorded in the Eynsham Cartulary in 1323. Variations of the surname include: Corbet , and Corbitt . Corbett is sometimes an Anglicised form of the Irish surnames \u00d3 Corb\u00e1in and \u00d3 Coirb\u00edn , which mean \"descendant of Corb\u00e1n \" and \"descendant of Coirb\u00edn \", respectively. </",

    "question": "where does silicon for solar panels come from",
    "long_answer": "Polysilicon is produced from metallurgical grade silicon by a chemical purification process, called the Siemens process . This process involves distillation of volatile silicon compounds, and their decomposition into silicon at high temperatures. An emerging, alternative process of refinement uses a fluidized bed reactor . The photovoltaic industry also produces upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si), using metallurgical instead of chemical purification processes. When produced for the electronics industry, polysilicon contains impurity levels of less than one part per billion (ppb), while polycrystalline solar grade silicon (SoG-Si) is generally less pure. A few companies from China, Germany, Japan, Korea and the United States, such as GCL-Poly , Wacker Chemie , OCI , and Hemlock Semiconductor , as well as the Norwegian headquartered REC , accounted for most of the worldwide production of about 230,000 tonnes in 2013.",

    "question": "where do they shoot the price is right",
    "long_answer": "Rio in Las Vegas, Nevada , The Price Is Right has been taped in Studio 33 in CBS Television City in Hollywood, California for its entire run. The studio, which is also used for other television productions, was renamed the Bob Barker Studio in the host's honor on the ceremonial 5,000th episode taped in March 1998. When Carey became host, there was talk of the show traveling in the future. The program is usually produced in about an hour, although if there is a guest involved, some tapings will last longer because of question and answer sessions by the audience and the guest, which the host usually moderates. Two episodes are usually taped each day, normally with three taping days per week (Monday through Wednesday, with one episode taped at 12:00 pm and another at 4:00 pm). The program is taped in advance of its airdate. For example, the show broadcast on February 28, 2008 was taped on January 16. As with many other shows that start production in the summer, the lead time varies during the season, as many as fifteen weeks to as little as one day. The audience is entertained by the announcer before taping begins and in case of guests, the guest will answer questions from the audience. After the taping session, there is a drawing for a door prize . On some episodes, all members of the audience receive a prize from a sponsor or celebrity guest; those prizes are usually mentioned in the Showcase (such as a complimentary slice of Papa John's Pizza, an NHL Winter Classic game puck, a couples' gift box from Hershey's or a book authored by a guest). Television and Internet viewers have also been directed to the show's official website to enter a drawing for a similar prize offered to all viewers or another prize related to the special offer (such as the Rock of Ages signed CD). Some episodes are taped \"out-of-order\" so that a specific episode will air after other episodes have aired. Notably, the Christmas Week episodes are usually taped in early December outside of the regular rotation. An episode may be taped out-of-order if a prize package reflects a trip to an event that is taking place close to the date that episode will air (primarily with CBS properties such as the Academy of Country Music Awards , NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship , and various NFL on CBS games, most notably CBS Super Bowl years since Carey took over, but other games are offered). Other episodes may be aired out-of-order because of game-related incidents or situations beyond the network's control. Most episodes which have aired out of order have occurred when the show is taped far in advance, but in the time between the show taping and its airdate, a natural disaster took place at the trip venue. This happened in June 2005 with episodes that featured trips to New Orleans (which was later struck by Hurricane Katrina ), with airdates moved to May and June 2006 and again in April 2010 with episodes that featured trips to Nashville, Tennessee (due to the May 2010 Tennesse",

    "question": "where does a tropical cyclone or hurricane get its energy",
    "long_answer": "tropical seas. \u201cCyclone\u201d refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye , with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and blowing clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect . Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation . This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms , such as nor'easters and European windstorms , which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts . Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (62 and 1,243 mi) in diameter. The strong rotating winds of a",

It is a ballad from Act Two, in which the character Desir\u00e9e reflects on the ironies and disappointments of her life. Among other things, she looks back on an affair years earlier with the lawyer Fredrik, who was deeply in love with her but whose marriage proposals she had rejected. Meeting him after so long, she realizes she is in love with him and finally ready to marry him, but now it is he who rejects her: he is in an unconsummated marriage with a much younger woman. Desir\u00e9e proposes marriage to rescue him from this situation, but he declines, citing his dedication to his bride. Reacting to his rejection, Desir\u00e9e sings this song. The song is later reprised as a coda after Fredrik's young wife runs away with his son, and Fredrik is finally free to accept Desir\u00e9e's offer.",

    "long_answer": "Joker in Christopher Nolan 's 2008 film The Dark Knight , released nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London, Ledger told Sarah Lyall in their New York Times interview that he viewed The Dark Knight ' s Joker as a \" psychopathic , mass murdering , schizophrenic clown with zero empathy \". For his work on The Dark Knight , Ledger won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor with his family accepting it on his behalf, as well as numerous other posthumous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor , which Christopher Nolan accepted for him.
